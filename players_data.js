        "Stats": "Career receptions: 387, Receiving yards: 7,029, Seasons: 12, Total TDs: 64",
        "Bio": "In a crucial game midway into the 1951 NFL season, the Los Angeles Rams found themselves trailing the Chicago Bears, 14-0, and deep in a hole on their own 9-yard line. Quarterback Bob Waterfield faked a handoff, stepped back a few paces and threw far downfield. Elroy Hirsch took off at the snap and was running full-throttle at midfield. Waterfield's pass was over his head but Elroy gathered in the ball on his fingertips and raced for a 91-yard touchdown. The Rams went on to an important 42-17 victory. It was a patented \"Elroy Hirsch special,\" a sizzling shocker that was repeated 17 times that year.Besides his 91-yard bomb, Elroy had numerous other long-yardage touchdowns as he established a new league record at the time of 1,495 yards receiving. It wasn' t just the number of long-gainers but the way he did the job that set Hirsch apart from all others. \"Crazylegs\" had a unique running style that made him famous. When running downfield, his muscular legs seemed to gyrate in six different directions at once.Pro football success did not come easily to Hirsch, even though he was an All-America halfback at both Wisconsin and Michigan before he joined the Chicago Rockets of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946. Hirsch described his three seasons in Chicago as \"frightful.\"When his AAFC contract expired, Hirsch happily joined the Rams. After a year spent mostly on the bench in 1949, Elroy was shifted to end. Not familiar with playing end, he initially struggled. However, hard work eventually paid off and, a year later, he became a primary contributor to the Rams' impressive march to the NFL title. Many observers insisted \u201cCrazylegs\u201d was the best end ever but Hirsch modestly downgraded his own case. \"I'm just a busted-down, retreaded halfback who happened to get lucky.\""

        "Bio": "When Herb Adderley reported to his first Green Bay training camp in 1961 as the Packers\u2019 No.1 draft pick, he had the unenviable task of competing against future Hall of Fame running backs Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung for a starter\u2019s spot. Midway through the season, however, Packers coach Vince Lombardi decided to try the former Michigan State star as an emergency replacement for injured starting cornerback Hank Gremminger.Adderley, using his speed and marvelous instincts, quickly demonstrated he had what it took to be an NFL cornerback. The 6-1, 205-pound Philadelphia native took immediate command in the Packers' defensive backfield and, within two years, had won All-NFL honors, acclaim he was to earn four more times in 1963, 1965, 1966 and 1969. A speed-burning ball hawk, Herb amassed 48 interceptions, returning them for 1,046 yards and a 21.8-yard average, with seven touchdowns during his 12-year career with the Packers (1961-69) and Dallas Cowboys (1970-72). He doubled as a kickoff return specialist during most of his Green Bay career and wound up with a 25.7-yard average on 120 returns. Included were a 103-yard return in 1962 and a 98-yard thrust in 1963.Lombardi once admitted that he almost made a mistake with Adderley. \u201cI was too stubborn to switch him to defense until I had to,\u201d he confessed. \u201cNow when I think of what Adderley means to our defense, it scares me to think of how I almost mishandled him.\u201d Adderley played in five Pro Bowl games during the 1960s and was seemingly a fixture in post-season games. He played in four of the first six Super Bowl games, winning championship rings in three of them. He also played in seven NFL championship games in an 11-year span from 1961 through 1971. His teams \u2013 the Packers five times and the Cowboys twice \u2013 won every one. Herb's 60-yard interception return for a clinching touchdown for the Packers in Super Bowl II was the only interception return for a touchdown in the first 10 Super Bowls."

        "Bio": "Quarterback Troy Aikman finished his collegiate career as the third rated passer in NCAA history. An All-America at UCLA, Aikman joined the Dallas Cowboys as the first overall pick in the 1989 NFL Draft. He became the first Dallas rookie quarterback to start a season opener since Roger Staubach in 1969. Although he showed great promise and threw for a rookie-record 379 yards in a game against the Phoenix Cardinals, the team finished 1-15. As the young quarterback improved, however, so too did the Cowboys' record.In 1990, Aikman completed 226 of 399 passes for 2,579 yards and 11 touchdowns - the team finished 7-9. The following year he completed an NFC-best 65.3 percent of his passes, and the Cowboys improved to 11-5 and advanced to the second round of the playoffs.In 1992, in just his 52nd game, Aikman reached the 10,000-yard passing mark, and his 302 completions were second most in team history. That season also marked the end of Dallas' odyssey from worst to first. With their high-powered offense and stingy defense, the 13-3 Cowboys swept through the 1992 NFL playoffs, scoring a combined total of 116 points in three games including a 52-17 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII. Aikman's 22 of 30 for 273 yards passing and four touchdowns earned him Super Bowl MVP honors.Over the next three seasons, the Cowboys enjoyed three consecutive 12-4 records and victories in Super Bowls XXVIII and XXX. Aikman, wide receiver Michael Irvin, and running back Emmitt Smith delivered an offensive attack that opponents found nearly impossible to contain. When defenses focused on Irvin and/or Smith, Aikman would find tight end Jay Novacek or wide receiver Alvin Harper. In the 1994 NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, Aikman completed 23 of 30 passes for 337 yards. Irvin, Novacek, and Harper, each had more than 100 yards receiving. Aikman's 94-yard touchdown pass to Harper was the longest play from scrimmage in NFL post-season history at the time.With 90 wins in the 1990s, Aikman became the winningest starting quarterback of any decade in NFL history at the time of his retirement. Unfortunately, during his final two seasons, injuries began to take a toll on the Dallas quarterback and the team's winning ways. Finally, after the 2000 season, the Cowboys' six-time Pro Bowl selection announced his retirement from football. His career statistics include 32,942 yards and 165 touchdowns for a passer rating of 81.6."

The Rams, prior to Allen taking the reins in 1966, had experienced seven straight losing seasons, including a 4-10 record in 1965. In Allen\u2019s first year, the team posted an 8-6 mark, and then won the NFL\u2019s Coastal Division with an excellent 11-1-2 record in 1967. That year, Allen was a virtually-unanimous NFL Coach of the Year choice. Allen moved to the Redskins in 1971 to lead a team that had had only one winning season in 15 years. Adopting the \u201cFuture Is Now\u201d theme, he made numerous trades, sacrificing future draft choices for veterans who could help immediately. In his 12 seasons in the NFL, he made 131 trades, 81 of them coming during his Washington tenure.Allen never had a losing season in seven years with the Redskins. The 1971 team finished second in the NFC\u2019s Eastern Division with a surprising 9-4-1 record. The next year the team marched to an 11-3-0 record, an NFC championship victory over Dallas and a Super Bowl VII appearance against the Miami Dolphins. Three times in the next four years, Washington had 10-4 seasons and wild-card berths in the post-season playoffs.Allen, who was born April 29, 1918, attended Alma College, Marquette University, and the University of Michigan before starting his coaching career at Morningside College in 1948. He moved to Whittier College in 1951 to begin a six-year tenure. Allen\u2019s first pro coaching experience was as an assistant to Sid Gillman with the Rams in 1957. A year later, he joined the Chicago Bears as a defensive assistant. In a rare move, he was presented a game ball following the 1963 NFL Championship Game in which his defense recorded five defensive turnovers."

        "Bio": "Larry Allen began his college football career at Butte Junior College in Oroville, Calif. before transferring to Sonoma State, a Division II school near San Francisco. He quickly developed a reputation as a dominant lineman and his stock rose among NFL scouts. The Dallas Cowboys used their second round pick, 46th player overall, in 1994 on Allen. He proved his worth by providing versatility for the Cowboys as he played every position on the offensive line but center during his 12 seasons in Dallas before playing two final years with the San Francisco 49ers (2006-07).\rAt 6\u20193\u201d, 325 pounds, Allen possessed great athleticism to complement his size and incredible strength. He started 10 games in his rookie season and split time between guard and tackle.\u00a0 In his second season, he was placed in the right guard spot and helped pave the way for Emmitt Smith who set a Cowboys single-season record with 1,773 yards rushing as Dallas finished fifth in total offense. Allen\u2019s contribution was recognized as he was named All-Pro for the first of seven consecutive seasons and named to the Pro Bowl for the first of 11 times in his career.\rAllen continued to shift between guard and tackle and continued to earn All-Pro honors and Pro Bowl nods as a guard. He finished the 1997 campaign and played all of 1998 as the Cowboys left tackle. His job of protecting Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman\u2019s blindside earned Allen All-Pro recognition and a Pro Bowl nod as a tackle in \u201898.\rAllen is among the rare group of players who have been named to multiple NFL All-Decade Teams (1990s and 2000s). A veteran of 203 career games, he played in two NFC championship games and was the starting right guard in the Cowboys 27-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX. \rHe was named the NFL\u2019s Offensive Lineman of the Year by the NFL Alumni in 1997 and by the NFL Players Association as the NFC Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1996 and 1997.

He\u2019s the NFL\u2019s all-time sack leader for cornerbacks and also made 88 tackles for loss. Twice he intercepted three passes in a game, and six times he forced at least two turnovers in a game. He scored 14 touchdowns on returns: eight interceptions, four fumbles and two deflected punts.\r\u00a0\rHe played big on big stages. In the 1999 NFC Championship Game, Barber made eight tackles, two behind the line, in an 11-6 loss to Rams. In the 2003 NFC title game, he returned an interception 92 yards for a touchdown to seal the 27-10 win over the Eagles and added a sack, forced fumble and four passes defensed. In the Super Bowl win over Oakland, he contributed five tackles.\r\u00a0\rBarber\u2019s breakout season came in 2001. He led the NFL with 10 interceptions, leading to the first of his three All-Pro honors and first of five Pro Bowl invitations. Twice that year he was named Defensive Player of the Week. He would earn that honor nine times in his career, matching the NFL record shared by RAY LEWIS, LAWRENCE TAYLOR, CHRIS DOLEMAN and BRUCE SMITH \u2014 all members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\r\u00a0\rBarber was voted to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 2000s (second team) and was the Buccaneers\u2019 winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in 2011, given across the NFL to a player from each team who demonstrates courage, sportsmanship and dedication to his hometown community.\u00a0\r\u00a0\r        "

Barney originally was tested as a wide receiver, but his exceptional skills as a defender could not be ignored. After a sensational rookie season, he was named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and selected to play in the Pro Bowl, something he would do six more times during his stellar career. Barney also tied for the NFL interception lead with 10. Three of his interceptions were returned for touchdowns, only\u00a0one short of the all-time single-season record at that time.Barney, a native of Gulfport, Miss.,\u00a0also won acclaim as a kick return specialist. Particularly early in his career, he saw duty on both the punt and kickoff return units, as well as playing full time at comerback. He was highly feared as a big-play threat for good reason. In his 11-year tenure that ended after the 1977 campaign, Barney had a 98-yard kickoff return, a 94-yard field goal return, a 74-yard punt return and a 71-yard interception runback for touchdowns.His career record includes 56 interceptions for 1,077 yards, 143 punt returns for 1,312 yards and 50 kickoff returns for 1,274 yards. He scored 11 touchdowns on seven interceptions, two punt returns, one kickoff return and one missed field goal return. He also recovered 11 fumbles and doubled as the Lions' punter in both 1967 and 1969. Barney was named All-NFL in 1968 and 1969 and All-NFC in 1972 and 1975."

        "Bio": "Cliff Battles, a sensational running back from West Virginia Wesleyan College won the National Football League rushing title in 1932 as a rookie with the Boston Braves. The next year the Braves were renamed the Redskins and Battles became the first player ever to rush for more than 200 yards in a game. He accomplished in the feat on October 8, 1933 in a game against the New York Giants as he rushed 16 times for 215 yards, and scored one touchdown.In 1937 Redskins George Preston Marshall moved his team from Boston to Washington. He brought Battles, the NFL's premier running back, with him and quickly added a sensational rookie passer, Sammy Baugh. It didn't seem out of the question that the Battles-Baugh ground and air threat would make the Redskins championship contenders for years to come. For the 1937 season, Baugh and Battles combined their talents just as everyone had anticipated. On the season\u2019s final day, Battles scored three touchdowns to power the Redskins to a 49-14 win over the New York Giants for the Eastern Division title. Against the Chicago Bears a week later, Battles scored the first touchdown in a 28-21 victory that gave the Redskins their first NFL championship.Battles was again the league\u2019s leading rusher and he won all-league honors for the fifth time in six years. In just six seasons, Battles totaled 3,511 yards rushing \u2013 really big numbers for that era \u2013 and Redskins fans looked forward to more of the same in the upcoming seasons. With Battles carrying the ball and Baugh tossing it, championships seemed assured.But it was not to be. Inexplicably, Marshall, who had paid Battles $3,000 a year, starting with his rookie campaign, refused to consider a raise, even though Cliff clearly was a star player with much fan appeal. After the season, the exasperated Battles accepted a $4,000 job as an assistant coach at Columbia University. The Redskins won only one more championship during Baugh\u2019s long and storied career. Loyal Redskins fans were left to wonder, \u201cwhat might have been\u201d if Marshall had only given Battles a raise."

The forward pass was something to be used with caution, and never inside your 30-yard line, except in desperate situations. By the time Baugh was through, the forward pass was a primary offensive weapon. Obviously, such a change could not be totally brought about by one individual. But Baugh was the catalyst that changed the game. No one had seen a passer who could throw with such accuracy.Baugh started his pro career as a single wing tailback and didn't make the switch to the T-formation until 1944. He won a record-setting six NFL passing titles and earned first-team All-NFL honors seven times in his career. Sammy also led the NFL in punting four straight years from 1940 through 1943.

As an offensive center, big Chuck was a bulldozing blocker, both on rushing and passing plays.

The 35-year-old was sensational. He finished the campaign with a 58-minute performance, capped by a game-saving tackle in the Eagles' NFL championship victory over Green Bay.

Steadfastly rejecting any settlement that would leave the AAFC intact, Bert finally presided over a \"merger\" after the 1949 season that brought three AAFC teams \u2013 Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and San Francisco 49ers \u2013 into the NFL.In Bell's first year as commissioner, he also took a strong anti-gambling stance that marked the start of tough conduct codes in the NFL. Another far-sighted action was Bell's handling of the-then young television industry. Realizing that televising home games would hurt stadium attendance and much-needed team revenues, Bell formulated the policy to permit only road games to be televised back to home cities, thus protecting gate revenues while making previously unavailable away games accessible to fans.Bell exhibited a rare fortitude when he first recognized the NFL Players' Association. Confronted by angry owners, he simply referred to the league's constitution, which permitted him to act on any matter \"in the best interests of pro football.\" Bell began his pro football life as the founder-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1933 and struggled with overwhelming financial adversity for the rest of the decade. A unique franchise shift in 1940 found Bell moving to Pittsburgh as part owner of the Steelers, a status he maintained until he was selected as commissioner. On October 11, 1959, while watching his \"two teams,\" the Eagles and Steelers, play at Philadelphia's Franklin Field; Bert suffered a fatal heart attack. The fact he died at an NFL game seemed appropriate for a man who had made pro football his entire life."

Why the Baltimore Colts selected him, even as a \u201cfuture choice\u201d on the 20th round of the 1954 draft, is a mystery. A long shot to make the Colts, Berry was determined. He practiced and practiced, catching passes from anyone willing to throw to him. He concentrated on making the difficult catch and running perfect patterns.Although he had just average speed, he developed, by his own count, 88 different moves to get open. He ran patterns within inches of how they were diagramed. In 1956, Johnny Unitas became the Colts\u2019 quarterback and Raymond was ready to put all his hours of practice to use. Together the two gave the Baltimore Colts one of the greatest pass-catch teams of all time. Three straight times Raymond led the league in receptions and caught a then-record 631 passes for 9,275 yards and 68 touchdowns in his 13-year career.A first- or second-team All-Pro choice in 1957 through 1961 and again in 1965, he was selected to play in six Pro Bowl games during his career. A sure-handed receiver, Raymond fumbled only once in 13 years. Perhaps his greatest moment came in the famous overtime 1958 NFL Championship Game. He set a then-record with 12 catches for 178 yards and a touchdown. Several of his grabs came in the Colts\u2019 life-or-death, last-minute drive to the tying field goal.

        "Bio": "Much has been said about many of the early pioneers of the game of professional football, whose dedication and determination against overwhelming odds kept the sport alive during the difficult years. The Arizona Cardinals owe their success and longevity to such a man. He was Charles Bidwill, Sr., who owned the team for 14 seasons from 1933 until 1946, when the franchise was located in Chicago. Even though the club never enjoyed even one financially successful year, Bidwill\u2019s faith in pro football remained always strong and solid. This could be considered a capsule summary of Bidwill\u2019s major contribution to the National Football League, but it is really only part of the story.In spite of Bidwill's enthusiasm for the game, the Cardinals were not a successful club during the 1930s and early 1940s and were always completely overshadowed by the cross-town rival Chicago Bears. In 1944, it was even prudent for the Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers to merge for a year to ease the financial strain and manpower crisis created by World War II.Still, Bidwill stayed the course. The end of the war brought another problem to the struggling owner. It came in the form of the All-America Football Conference and another rival team in Chicago, the Rockets. But it was Bidwill who delivered the AAFC one of its most stunning defeats when he signed everybody's All-America, Charley Trippi of Georgia, to a then unprecedented $100,000 contract. Trippi was the final link in \"Blue Shirt Charley's\" so-called \"Dream Backfield\" of Paul Christman, Pat Harder, Marshall Goldberg, and Trippi. This quartette would lead the Cardinals to their finest achievements - an NFL championship in 1947 and a division title in 1948.

Next came a winning touchdown toss against Denver and a last-instant field goal to upend San Diego.During his career, Blanda accumulated impressive credentials. He passed for 236 touchdowns and scored an incredible 2,002 points. In 1970, he became the oldest quarterback to play in a title game. Although the Baltimore Colts won 27-17, Blanda accounted for all of the Raiders' points off two touchdown passes and one field goal. Blanda\u2019s career was divided into three distinct parts, 10 years with the Chicago Bears followed by seven seasons with the Houston Oilers and nine-years with the Oakland Raiders. He was just a month shy of his 49th birthday when he retired before the 1976 season.Blanda did not become a fulltime starter until his fifth season with the Bears and in 1954 he was shelved by an injury. In 1959, he balked at becoming a kicker-only and retired. But the emergence of the American Football League in 1960 gave Blanda another chance to play. He went on to lead the Oilers to the first two AFL titles and won AFL Player of the Year honors in 1961. In 1967, when Blanda was almost 40, the Oilers decided he was through but the Raiders saw George as a contributing backup passer and a dependable kicker so they picked him up. George handled both jobs with distinction for another nine seasons."

        "Bio": "Mel Blount was the prototype cornerback of his era and a major reason why the Steelers were the dominant team of the National Football League in the 1970s. A third-round draft choice of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1970, he had ideal size, speed, and quickness, plus the toughness and mental ability to adjust his coverage tactics to rule changes that favored receivers.A Pro Scouts All-America as both a safety and cornerback at Southern University, Blount became a starter in the Steelers secondary beginning in 1972. That season, he didn\u2019t allow a single touchdown. A fixture at right cornerback, Mel was equally effective playing either zone or man-to-man defense. Known for his rugged but clean style of play, his specialty was the \u201cbump-and-run\u201d pass defense. Because of his size and speed, he literally overpowered pass receivers.Midway through his career, however, the rules were changed making such harassment of a receiver illegal. Blount, a native of Vidalia, Georgia, wound up his career with 57 interceptions which he returned for 736 yards and two touchdowns. He intercepted at least one pass in all 14 NFL seasons and led the league in interceptions with 11 in 1975. Blount also was used as a kickoff returner early in his career. He wound up with 36 returns for 911 yards and a 25.3-yard average. He also recovered 13 opponents' fumbles, two of which he returned for touchdowns.Blount, who was named the NFL's most valuable defensive player in 1975 by the Associated Press, earned all-pro acclaim in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1981. He also was a four-time All-AFC selection and played in five Pro Bowls. His fumble recovery in the 1979 AFC Championship Game led to the Steelers' winning touchdown in a 27-13 victory over the Houston Oilers. A season earlier in Super Bowl XIII, Blount's interception ignited a Pittsburgh drive that resulted in a go-ahead touchdown in a 35-31 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. He started in four Steelers' Super Bowl victories (IX, X, XIII, and XIV)."

Immediately, he hired a full-time staff on a year-round basis and he instituted a system for scouting college talent on a scale never before imagined by other pro teams. In his handling of his team, he became the first to (1) use intelligence tests as a hint to a player's learning potential, (2) use notebooks and classroom techniques extensively, (3) set up complete film clip statistical studies and (4) grade his own players based on film study. Brown, always a firm disciplinarian, was the first coach to keep his players together at a hotel the night before a home game as well as a road game.From the strategic standpoint, he started the practice of calling plays from the sideline by utilizing alternating guards as messengers. He developed detailed pass patterns for the offense that were designed to pick holes in the defense, but then he devoted his efforts to perfecting the kind of a defense that could counteract a pattern passing attack.Brown built a pro football dynasty in Cleveland, posting a 167-53-8 record, four AAFC titles, three NFL crowns and only one losing season in 17 years. In the four seasons the Browns operated in the AAFC, they lost just four games.

        "Bio": "Tim Brown proved to be everything that the Los Angeles Raiders had hoped for after selecting the Heisman Trophy winner out of Notre Dame in the first round, sixth overall, of the 1988 NFL Draft. Over the next 17 seasons, all but one year spent with the Raiders in Los Angeles and later Oakland, Brown developed into one of the greatest receivers of his era.He managed to haul in 43 receptions and score 5 TDs as a rookie but it was as a kick returner that he received accolades. Brown was named first-team All-Pro and to the Pro Bowl after leading the NFL in kickoff returns (41 for 1,098 yards, 26.8 average, and 1 TD) and setting a rookie record for combined net yards.Brown suffered a season-ending injury in the opener the following year. He returned in 1990 and was used mostly as a punt returner but also caught a combined 103 catches over the next three seasons. Then, in 1993, he had a breakout year as he registered 80 catches for 1,180 yards and 7 touchdowns. He followed that with back-to-back 89-catch seasons and recorded 90 receptions in 1996. All the while, he continued to be a productive punt returner for the team.Starting in 1993, Brown recorded nine straight 1,000-yard seasons and 10 consecutive years with 75 or more catches. His best season came in 1997, a year in which he became the Raiders\u2019 all-time receiving leader. He caught 104 catches for 1,408 yards to win the NFL receiving title. He set a team record with seven 100-yard games and tied a NFL mark with five games with 150-plus yards receiving. Brown was named to the Sporting News\u2019 All-Pro team that season. He also enjoyed his seventh of nine Pro Bowl berths.Brown was named first-team All-AFC six times \u2013 once as a kick returner, once as a punt returner, and four times at wide receiver. He was also named to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 1990s.He retired after one final season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004 as the third all-time leading receiver with 1,094 receptions for 14,934 yards, and 100 touchdowns. At the time he also ranked fifth in career combined net yardage with 19,682 yards.  "

Even though the Broncos were not successful on the playing field during Willie\u2019s four years in Denver, the 6-1, 195-pound cornerback was already an established star by the time he was traded to the Raiders in 1967.With a perpetually contending team in Oakland, Willie's outstanding abilities emerged into clear focus. During his 12 years in Oakland, the Raiders played in three AFL and six AFC championship games, as well as Super Bowls II and XI. Armed with speed, mobility, aggressiveness, determination and a keen football sense, Brown became a key figure in every Raider success and soon was widely acclaimed as one of the premier cornerbacks of all time.Willie, who was born December 2, 1940, in Yazoo City, Mississippi, was an excellent end for four years at Grambling but was not drafted when his college career ended in 1963. He was signed by the Houston Oilers as a free agent but cut before the end of summer camp. He then went to Denver where he became a starter midway into his rookie season. A year later, he intercepted four passes against the New York Jets to tie an all-time individual record, won All-AFL honors, and played in his first AFL All-Star game, where he was named the outstanding defensive player.Altogether, Brown was named to an all-league team seven years, three seasons as All-AFL and four more as All-NFL. He was named All-AFC four times. He also played in five AFL All-Star games and four Pro Bowls. During his career, he intercepted 54 passes, which he returned for 472 yards and two touchdowns. His biggest steal, however, came in Super Bowl XI, when he returned an interception 75 yards for a clinching touchdown."

Eddie Robinson, his coach at Grambling, where he had been an NAIA All-America in 1962, called him \"the finest lineman I have seen.\"Others who had watched Buchanan in action were equally enthusiastic. Born September 10, 1940, in Gainesville, Alabama, Buchanan had the physical size \u2013 6-7 and 270 pounds \u2013 plus the athletic instincts to be exceptionally successful at his job of foiling opposition offenses. He was particularly effective at intimidating the passer and, in one season alone in 1967, he batted down 16 opposition passes at or behind the line of scrimmage. He was clocked at 4.9 in the 40 and 10.2 in the 100 at Grambling and, with that speed; he could range from sideline to sideline to make tackles.In spite of the weekly pounding he took on the scrimmage line, Buchanan was extremely durable. He played in 182 career games that included a string of 166 straight. After dabbling briefly at defensive end as a rookie, Buchanan settled down to his permanent job as the Chiefs' defensive right tackle. He was named to his first AFL All-Star game after his second season in 1964. It was the first of an eight-season period during which he played in either the AFL All-Star game or the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl. He was a virtually unanimous All-AFL choice from 1966 through 1969 and then won All-AFC honors in 1970 and 1971. He was a defensive leader for the Chiefs in their losing effort in Super Bowl I and then was outstanding in Kansas City's 23-7 upset of Minnesota in Super Bowl IV that saw the Buchanan-led defense completely stifle the vaunted Vikings attack."

He wasn\u2019t even drafted by a National Football League team, and lasted until the thirteenth round of the 1962 American Football League Draft, before being tapped by the Boston Patriots. Even his coach at Notre Dame advised AFL and NFL scouts that he was too small to play in the pros. However, as several coaches later noted, Buoniconti \u201cplayed bigger than his size.\u201dThe 5-11, 220-pound middle linebacker went on to play 14 seasons (1962-1974, 1976) with the Patriots and the Miami Dolphins.

Carr's persistence finally paid off when, in 1920, the American Professional Football Association (APFA) was organized in Canton, Ohio. Jim Thorpe, the best-known name of pro football in 1920, was named the APFA's first president. But a year later Carr replaced him in the leadership role.The next year, in 1922, the league changed its name to the National Football League. Carr strongly felt the public had the inherent right to know the league was being run honestly and capably. Immediately, he established a standard player contract modeled on the one used in baseball. He cracked down on the hiring of collegians under assumed names. When the Green Bay Packers, a new team in 1921, ignored Carr's edict, he forfeited the franchise and then renewed it under new ownership a few months later.In 1925, Red Grange stunned the football world by joining the Chicago Bears just 10 days after his final game with the University of Illinois. Sensing that resentment in college circles would persist if such practices continued, Carr ruled, in the future, no NFL team could sign a college player until his eligibility was completed. Violators were promised a stiff fine or loss of franchise or both. Carr recognized that, to survive, the NFL needed teams in large cities. His first target was New York City and, through Joe's efforts, the New York Giants were born in 1925. The 70,000 crowd that turned out at the Polo Grounds later that year to see the Red Grange-led Bears proved big-city fans would support pro football.A dedicated, no-nonsense administrator, Carr also served in executive positions in minor-league baseball and professional basketball during his tenure as NFL president."

Selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft, he was immediately moved to the linebacker position in the pros. Carson won the starting middle linebacker position halfway through that rookie season and went on to be named to the All-NFL Rookie Team.An emotional player, Carson led by example both on and off the field. He led all Giants defenders in tackles five seasons and was named to the Pro Bowl nine times, including seven straight from 1982 through 1988. His best single-game performance came in 1982 in a Monday night game versus the Green Bay Packers in which he racked up 20 solo tackles and five assists.

Known for his \"all-out\" style of play, he attacked onrushing blockers head on in his pursuit of the ball carrier. Later in his career when he was joined by outside linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks, there was no better linebacker trio in the NFL. Like Taylor, he was extremely difficult to defense in blitzing situations and he had the speed and agility to be an effective pursuit player, even when the play was directed away from his area of responsibility.In 1986, Carson finished second in total tackles for the Giants with 118 in the regular season and 23 in the playoffs. He recorded the ninth of his 11 career interceptions, had two quarterback sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two forced fumbles, as the Giants went on to defeat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.Although he was a very consistent player, Carson seemed to produce top performances in key games. That was the case in New York's Super Bowl season. His interception and 12 solo tackles against the Washington Redskins on December 7 virtually assured the Giants of the NFC East title. It was also Carson who made the \"big play\" on the Giants' first-half goal line stand against the Broncos in the Super Bowl, when he stuffed Gerald Willhite for no gain.In addition to his nine Pro Bowl appearances, Carson was named first- or second-team All-Pro six times and first- or second-team All-NFC six times."

        "Bio": "Cris Carter, a fourth round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1987 Supplemental Draft, started his pro career on a high note as his first NFL catch came on a 22-yard touchdown play in a game against St. Louis Cardinals.Scoring touchdowns turned out to be something for which Carter became known for during his 16-season NFL career. By the time he retired following the 2002 NFL season, Carter had scored 130 touchdowns which ranked second most in NFL history.Carter's career started slowly as he showed occasional flashes of brilliance during his three seasons with the Eagles but consistent success did not begin until after he joined the Minnesota Vikings in 1990. Over the next 12 seasons in Minnesota, Carter developed into one of the game's most prolific pass receivers. He led the Vikings in receptions for 10 straight seasons (1991-2000) but it was his 1993 season when he raised his play to a new level. That year, he recorded the first of eight straight 1,000-yard seasons and also earned his first of eight consecutive Pro Bowl berths.\rThe following season, Carter set a then-NFL record for receptions in a season when he hauled in 122 passes for 1,256 yards and scored 7 touchdowns. His finest season came one year later when, in 1995, he registered his second straight 122-catch season and amassed a career-high 1,371 yards and 17 touchdowns. His two-year total of 244 catches was the most in NFL history.\r\r\rCarter, who held or shared 19 Vikings team records, decided to retire following the 2001 season. However, after injuries decimated the Miami Dolphins' receiving corps in 2002, Carter returned to the field and played five games for the Dolphins that season before he permanently retired.Known for his durability, Carter played full 16-game seasons in 13 of his 16 years in the NFL. He finished his 234-game career as the NFL's second all-time leading receiver with 1,101 receptions for 13,899 yards. A member of the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 1990s, Carter had 10 or more touchdowns in a season six times and led the NFL in receiving touchdowns three times (1995, 1997, and 1999). He recorded 70 or more catches in a season 10 times and had 100-yard receiving games 42 times during his career."

The Oakland Raiders selected him in the second round of the 1974 National Football League Draft.Used primarily on special teams his first two years in Oakland, he earned a starter\u2019s role in 1976 and quickly established himself as a dominant player, finishing the season with an impressive 53 catches for 691 yards and 10 touchdowns. His outstanding play invigorated the Raiders\u2019 offense with a blend of pass catching and blocking that culminated in a 32-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl XI. Nicknamed \u201cThe Ghost\u201d by his teammates, Casper was not only a great receiver and blocker, he was also a clutch performer.Two of the game\u2019s most memorable plays involved the sure-handed tight end. In the 1977 AFC playoff game between the Raiders and the Baltimore Colts, it was Casper\u2019s 10-yard touchdown reception that ended the double-overtime affair, 37-31, in favor of the Raiders. \u201cGhost to the Post,\u201d the game is called in reference to Casper\u2019s 42-yard reception route that set up the tying field goal at the end of regulation.Early the next season, Casper again pulled his team from certain defeat, on a play that would forever be remembered as \u201cThe Holy Roller.\u201d Down six points to the San Diego Chargers with 10 seconds remaining in the game, Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler fumbled the ball. The ball rolled 13 yards to the Chargers 11, where running back Pete Banaszak batted it toward the goal line. At the 5, a quick thinking Casper continued the ball\u2019s forward progress with his foot before finally falling on it in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.Casper played six and a half seasons with the Raiders. During that time he was named All-Pro and All-AFC four times and was selected to play in four Pro Bowls. Midway through the 1980 season he was traded to the Houston Oilers for a first-round and two second-round draft picks. There he was reunited with Stabler who was traded to the Oilers at the start of the season. Casper finished the season with 56 receptions and was named to his fifth Pro Bowl. In 1984, after a brief stint with the Minnesota Vikings, Casper returned to the Raiders finishing his career with 378 receptions for 5,216 yards and 52 touchdowns."

Winning was a category in which Chamberlin excelled. Of those coaches with 50 or more victories, Guy's 58-16-7 record and .759 winning percentage ranks among the best.In his six coaching seasons, five of which were spent as a player-coach, Chamberlin also won four NFL championships for the Canton Bulldogs in 1922 and 1923, the Cleveland Bulldogs in 1924, and the Frankford Yellowjackets in 1926. Although Chamberlin's high school in Blue Springs, Nebraska, was not big enough to field a football team, he became a two-time All-America at the University of Nebraska.Jim Thorpe, who had always been Chamberlin\u2019s idol, lured Guy into pro football with the pre-NFL Canton Bulldogs in 1919. Chamberlin was one of the finest ends of his time. When George Halas began lining up players for his first Decatur Staleys team in 1920, Chamberlin was his prime recruit. He was big, tall and fast, excellent on both offense and defense and a 60-minute player.After two seasons with Halas and the Staleys, Chamberlin came back to Canton as player-coach of the Bulldogs. Thorpe was no longer with the team but Chamberlin assembled one of the powerhouse elevens of the 1920s. Canton, with undefeated seasons in both 1922 and 1923, became the NFL's first two-time champion. The Bulldogs were sold in 1924 to a Cleveland promoter who added several Bulldogs\u2019 players to his Cleveland team. Chamberlin led the rebuilt Cleveland team to the NFL championship.In 1925, Chamberlin joined the Frankford Yellowjackets and a year later won another NFL title with a 14-1-2 record.

        "Bio": "Because he felt he was too small, Jack Christiansen didn't even plan to play college football. He first thought that he would concentrate as a sprinter on the track team at Colorado State. But he was coaxed out for football as a sophomore and he starred in the very first game he ever played. From then on for the next three years, Christiansen was a star as a return man, on defense, and as a ball carrier.Still his size \u2013 6-1 and 162 pounds at the time \u2013 may have left some doubts in the minds of some pro scouts whether he could make it in professional football. But the Lions did draft him in 1951 and, right from the start, he enjoyed spectacular success. In one crucial contest against the Los Angeles Rams as a rookie, Christiansen scored twice on punt returns of 69 and 47 yards. He also scored on two punt returns (71 and 89 yards) against the Green Bay Packers that season. So effective as a punt returner, teams were forced to change their defensive strategy.Soon all the teams were using the spread punt formation to try to contain the elusive Christiansen. As great as he was on the return teams, Jack's forte was defense and he was the key man for the defensively-strong Lions, who in the 1950s dominated the National Football League with four divisional and three world championships.The defensive backfield of the Lions became known as \u201cChris\u2019 Crew,\u201d in recognition of Christiansen\u2019s leadership and outstanding play. On the field, he was the defensive boss and ran the show. He led the league in interceptions in 1953 and tied for the league lead in 1957. Just like teams did on punt formations, opposing teams altered their passing patterns against Detroit. Many clubs had a standard rule when playing Detroit \u2014 don't throw in Christiansen's area, and don't punt to him. Christiansen played eight seasons with the Lions from 1951-58 and was named All-Pro six consecutive years (1952-1957) and played in five consecutive Pro Bowls (1954-1958)."

However, Clark returned to pro football in 1934 rejoining his team, which by then had been sold and had become the Detroit Lions. For the next five years, Clark, from his tailback position, was the general in Detroit's famed infantry attack that in 1936 set a team rushing record that stood for 36 years.He was called the quarterback because he called the plays. A true triple-threat back, Dutch consistently finished among the leaders in rushing and once completed 53.5 percent of his passes in a season when the league average was just 36.5 percent. He also led the league in scoring three times, kicked field goals and extra points and, is generally considered the last of the great drop kickers.The versatile Clark was All-NFL six of the seven seasons he played.

In 1952 and 1953, he was named all-league on both the offensive and defensive teams by different wire services.Although George is remembered as one of the finest of the post-World War II tackles, it was as a linebacker that he made his biggest mark in the pro football world. And it was the sheer necessity of a desperate situation for the Chicago Bears that prompted George's switch to a linebacker position.The Philadelphia Eagles were running roughshod over the NFL in 1949 and one end sweep with two guards and the fullback leading Steve Van Buren around the flank had been particularly successful. The Bears coaching staff hit upon the idea of moving a big, fast, and agile man like the 6-3, 240-pound Connor into a linebacker\u2019s slot to try to stop the play. The move was made, the experiment was successful, the Eagles were beaten and Connor became a linebacker for keeps.That didn't mean, however, that he was a one-way specialist. He continued to play offensive tackle, winning All-NFL acclaim on both offense and defense. George was always one of the smartest men on the field wherever he played. He seemingly instinctively knew about keys \u2013 the tips that the movements of certain offensive players will provide to the alert defender as to which way the play if going \u2013 long before keys became the vogue.Connor always played the game hard and clean and with exceptional effectiveness and he might have continued in a starring role for many years had not a knee injury cut short his career after the 1955 season."

One of his Great Lakes teammates was George Halas, who recruited him for his 1920 Decatur Staleys team in the newly formed American Professional Football Association, which later changed its name to the National Football League.After one season with the Staleys, Conzelman moved on to the Rock Island Independents where he began his career as a player-coach. He stayed with the Independents through seven games of the 1922 season before jumping to the Milwaukee Badgers for the remainder of the season and the 1923 season. Offered an NFL franchise in Detroit in 1925 for a reported $100 investment, Conzelman became an NFL owner. Although the team was fairly successful on the field (8-2-2 in 1925 and 4-6-2 in 1926) the team received little support from the Motor City fans.Eventually he returned the franchise back to the league and in 1927 joined the Providence Steam Roller as the player-coach. Quarterback Conzelman suffered a knee injury in 1928, but coach Conzelman led the team to an 8-1-2 record and the NFL title. Conzelman left Providence in 1930 wanting to try his hand at other careers. But, in 1940, the popular Irishman was lured back into the NFL with the Chicago Cardinals. He helped the team stay strong during the challenging World War II years before leaving to work in major league baseball. In 1946, Conzelman returned to the Cardinals.

When the WFL folded, he joined the New York Giants as a free agent in 1976. He enjoyed moderate success for three seasons with the Giants before returning to the Dolphins for a final 1979 season. Csonka's final fling proved to be a success. His 873 yards rushing was his best since 1973, and his 13 total touchdowns and 12 touchdowns rushing both were career highs."

His 2,105 total yards rushing in 1984 shattered Simpson\u2019s 1973 record of 2,003 yards rushing in a single season.A workhorse runner with the Rams, Dickerson gained more than 1,000 yards each of his first four seasons with the team. In three of those seasons he gained more than 1,800 yards. Although he rushed for 1,234 yards in 1985, he missed the Pro Bowl for the first time in his short NFL career. He did, however, go on to rush for a playoff record 248 yards against the Dallas Cowboys in post-season play.After playing just three games for the Rams during the strike-shortened 1987 season, Dickerson \u2013 in a blockbuster deal \u2013 was traded to the Indianapolis Colts. Although he played in just nine games with the Colts that year, he still managed to gain 1,011 yards to finish the season with 1,288. In 1988, Dickerson, with 1,659 yards rushing, became the first Colt to lead the league in rushing since Alan Ameche in 1955.The following season he became the first player in NFL history to gain more than 1,000 yards in seven consecutive seasons. He also became the seventh back to gain more than 10,000 yards and the fastest ever to do so, reaching the milestone in just 91 games. During his 11-year career, Dickerson gained 13,259 yards rushing, which was second all-time at the time of his retirement. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Dickerson was All-Pro in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1988."

        "Bio": "Dan Dierdorf excelled as an offensive lineman for 13 seasons from 1971 through 1983. He seemed destined for stardom from the moment he joined the St. Louis Cardinals as a second-round choice and the 43rd player selected in the 1971 draft.Dierdorf, who had been a consensus All-America at Michigan in 1970, possessed size, speed, quickness, discipline, intelligence and consistency, all necessary attributes for an outstanding lineman. The 6-3, 275-pounder from Canton, Ohio, where he was born on June 29, 1949, played both guard and tackle his first two seasons before settling down as the permanent right tackle in his third season. Dierdorf, who was equally effective as a blocker on both running and passing plays, was the ring-leader of the line that permitted the fewest sacks in the NFC for five straight years in the mid-1970s. In 1975, the Cardinals set a then-record by allowing only eight sacks in 14 games.He proved his durability by playing in every game until a broken jaw forced him out of two games in his seventh season in 1977. In 1979, he did miss 14 of 16 games because of a dislocated left knee. However, he bounced back strongly in 1980 with another all-pro caliber season. In 1982, Dierdorf unselfishly responded to a personnel emergency on the offensive line by agreeing to move to center. He not only made a smooth adjustment to the new position but he proved to be especially effective blocking against the bigger nose tackles of the new 3-4 defensive alignments he had to face.Dierdorf was named All-Pro five seasons \u2013 from 1975 to 1978 and again in 1980. He was elected to six Pro Bowl games, missing only once from 1974 through 1980. The NFL Players Association picked him as the best overall blocker in the NFL three straight years from 1976 to 1978"

In 1967, Ditka was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles. An injury in the second game that year aborted his consecutive-game streak at 86. He missed eight games in two years with the Eagles before moving on to the Dallas Cowboys in 1969. The fiercely determined and competitive Ditka regained much of his old form in four years in Dallas. His best campaign there was in 1971 when the Cowboys won their first Super Bowl championship.

It was then that he unleashed his great pass rushing ability when he responded with a team-high 11 sacks in 1987. It marked the first of six sack titles with the Vikings. For his efforts he was named All-Pro, All-NFC and voted to his first Pro Bowl.His finest season came two years later in 1989 when he led the NFL with 21 sacks, just one shy of the single-season record at the time. In 1992, he was named the NFC's Defensive Player of the Year after he led the Vikings with 14.5 sacks, had 64 tackles, returned an interception for a touchdown, forced six fumbles, recovered three fumbles, and had a safety.After nine seasons with Minnesota, Doleman was dealt to the Atlanta Falcons in 1994.

Aside from leading the Vikings in sacks six times, Doleman was also the Falcons' leading sacker in 1995 and led the 49ers with 15 sacks in 1998. He also intercepted eight passes, two of which he returned for touchdowns; recorded two safeties; and scored a touchdown on a fumble recovery during his career.Doleman was extremely durable as evidenced by him missing a mere two games due to injury during his 15-season, 232-game NFL career.

The hapless Colts folded after one season, and Art moved to the New York Yanks in 1951, then played for the Dallas Texans in 1952.In 1953, the well-traveled Donovan returned to Baltimore to play for the new Colts team and, as the Colts developed into a championship team, Donovan developed into one of the best defensive tackles in league history.Artie was ready for stardom.

He was equally adept at rushing the passer, reading keys, closing off the middle, and splitting double team blocks. He had the reputation of being almost impossible to trap.As great of a contributor as he was on the field, many feel he was at least as valuable to the Colts as a morale builder with his sharp wit and contagious laughter.

        "Bio": "The term \"franchise player\" is used to describe a star who, by the excellence of his play on the field, plays a major role in his team's success or, in some cases, its very existence. John \"Paddy\" Driscoll, who excelled as a quarterback and halfback, proved himself to be a franchise player of the rarest kind.The Chicago Cardinals, a charter member of the National Football League were challenged in the Windy City by another league team, the Tigers. The Cardinals hired Driscoll, for the then-princely sum of $300 a game in an effort to bolster the team\u2019s performance on the field and in the box office. In a mid-season game against the Tigers, Driscoll scored the game\u2019s only touchdown to lead the Cardinals to a 6-0 victory, giving them bragging rights as Chicago\u2019s best.The Tigers folded following the 1920 season. Driscoll at just 5-11 and 160 pounds was not very big. But size didn\u2019t prevent him from excelling on both offense and defense, and he was particularly skilled in punting and dropkicking. After the Bears moved to Chicago in 1921, they quickly became the Cardinals archrivals. Driscoll seemed always to be at his peak when the two teams played. In 1922, he scored all the points on dropkicked field goals as the Cardinals beat the Bears, 6-0 and 9-0.When the famed Red Grange made his pro debut against the Cardinals in 1925, Driscoll angered the large crowd by continually punting away from the \u201cGalloping Ghost.\u201d \"I decided if one of us was going to look bad, it wasn't going to be me. Punting to Grange is like grooving a pitch to Babe Ruth,\" he explained. The possibility that Driscoll might defect to a new league being formed in 1926 prompted his trade to the Bears, where he continued to subdue the opposition single-handed through the remainder of his career that ended following the 1929 season."

He returned punts and kickoffs, caught passes, and was a deadly defender.Dudley, who was nicknamed \u201cBullet Bill,\u201d even though he was never considered to be fast, was a first round draft pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1942. He demonstrated from the start that his relatively small size and lack of blazing speed wasn\u2019t a detriment. In the first game of his pro career he ran for a 55-yard touchdown and in his second game scored on a kickoff return. He finished his rookie season as the league\u2019s leading rusher with 696 yards and earned all-league honors.Dudley\u2019s nine-year National Football League career was unique in that he played three seasons each with the Steelers (1942, 1945-1946), Detroit Lions (1947-1949), and Washington Redskins (1950-1951, 1953). His career was interrupted in 1943 and 1944 when he served with the Army Air Corp during World War II.He returned to the Steelers during the 1945 campaign. The 1946 season was, for Dudley, one for the record book; as he led the league in rushing, punt returns, interceptions, and lateral passes attempted. Never before had an NFL player led the league in four distinctly different statistical categories, and it\u2019s not likely to happen again anytime soon. Naturally, Bill was named the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player that year.The following season, Bill again demonstrated his tremendous versatility when he scored 11 touchdowns for the Lions on one punt return, one interception return, seven pass receptions, and two rushes. Six times Dudley was named first- or second-team All-NFL.

A 6-2, 255-pound tackle does not create unusual notice today, but in the 1930s, a player of that stature stood out like the Rock of Gibraltar. And that is the way Edwards played the game \u2014 typifying overwhelming strength and power and yet he possessed enough agility to do a superb job every minute of every game.Like many of his time, Turk was an iron man, playing on both offense and defense.

After calling the coin toss and shaking hands with the opposing team captain, Edwards attempted to pivot around to head back to his sideline. However, his cleats caught in the grass and his oft-injured knee gave way, bringing his season and career to an unusual end.He stayed on with the Redskins first as an assistant coach and then as head coach until after the 1946 season.

A 6-6, 247-pound defensive stalwart, Eller opted to stay in a familiar environment and signed with the Vikings. For the next 15 years through 1978, he was a fixture in one of pro footballs most effective defensive alignments. He finished his career with one season with the Seattle Seahawks in 1979, having played in 225 regular-season games.During Eller\u2019s career, the Vikings enjoyed great success on the field.

The Vikings won the 1969 NFL championship and NFC crowns in 1973, 1974, and 1976 and played in four Super Bowls.A major factor in this long string of successes was a ferocious defensive line often referred to as \u201cThe Purple People Eaters.\u201d Eller was the left end of a line that included Jim Marshall at the opposite end and Hall of Famer Alan Page and Gary Larsen at the tackles. Extremely quick and mobile for his size, Carl was an excellent defender against the run and superb as a pass rusher. In one three-season string (1975-77), he recorded 44 sacks, according to unofficial statistics. (Sacks did not become an official NFL statistic until 1982). He also was effective in blocking kicks and during his career recovered 23 opponents\u2019 fumbles, the third-best mark in NFL annals at the time of his retirement. It was Eller who caused the fumble that led to teammate Jim Marshall\u2019s infamous wrong-way run for a safety in 1964 in a game against the San Francisco 49ers.Super-stardom was predicted for Eller from his first day in training camp following the 1964 College All-Star Game.

He became a regular his rookie season and was named first- or second-team All-Pro every year from 1967 through 1973. He was All-NFL or All-NFC 1968 through 1973 and then All-NFC again in 1975.

It was Denver\u2019s first Super Bowl victory. Elway would go on to lead his team to a second Super Bowl win a year later, capturing game Most Valuable Player honors in the process.A first-round draft choice of the Baltimore Colts in 1983, Elway was immediately traded to the Broncos for two veteran players and a 1984 first-round pick. As the Broncos signal caller, Elway almost at once became one of the most feared quarterbacks in the league. From 1983 through 1998, he led his team to five victories in six AFC championship games and two Super Bowl wins. Elway\u2019s record 47 fourth quarter game-winning or game-tying drives are legendary. In the 1986 AFC title game, Elway engineered a 98-yard come-from-behind touchdown drive to tie the Cleveland Browns and send the game into overtime. The Broncos went on to win 23-20. Today, the Elway-led fourth-quarter rally is simply referred to as \u201cThe Drive.\u201dThe versatile Elway is the only player in National Football League history to pass for more than 3,000 yards and rush for more than 200 yards in the same season seven consecutive times. He was only the second quarterback in NFL history to record more than 40,000 yards passing and 3,000 yards rushing during his career. At the time of his retirement, he\u00a0ranked second all-time in three of the game\u2019s most significant passing categories, passing yards (51,475), attempts (7,250), and completions (4,123).Indicative of his versatility, Elway was responsible for 334 touchdowns (300 passing; 33 rushing and one receiving) generating 4,771 of the 5,806 points (82.2%) scored by the Broncos during his 16-year tenure with the club. Selected to play in nine Pro Bowl games, Elway was a first- or second-team All-Pro choice three times and a first- or second-team All-AFC choice five times. In addition to his all-league honors, he was named the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player in 1987, AFC Offensive Player of the Year in 1993, and Super Bowl XXXIII Most Valuable Player.\u00a0"

        "Bio": "When Weeb Ewbank started his National Football League head coaching career with the 1954 Baltimore Colts, he was 47, not the age you ordinarily look for in a rookie coach. But the popular Ewbank stayed in command for the next 20 years, the first nine in Baltimore and the final 11 with the New York Jets. In so doing, he made an impact on pro football that has done much to insure its emergence as America's most popular spectator sport.He is the only coach to lead teams from both the National and American Football Leagues to world championships. His Colts won NFL crowns in both 1958 and 1959 and the 1968 Jets followed up their AFL championship with victory in Super Bowl III. Of even more importance than the mere fact of victory itself is the effect that these Ewbank championships had on the growth of pro football.Millions of fans watched on national television for the first time as the Colts defeated the New York Giants, 23-17, in overtime in 1958. Many still call this game \"the greatest ever played\" and there is no doubt the highly competitive nature of the contest did much to increase fan enthusiasm and anticipation in the years ahead.A decade later, Weeb\u2019s old team, the Colts, was heavily favored to make it three straight Super Bowl victories for the supposedly superior NFL over the overmatched AFL. But spurred along by Weeb's careful prodding the Jets pulled one of the most stunning upsets in history. The competitive validity of the Super Bowl was never again in doubt.In both Baltimore and New York, Weeb inherited young, disorganized teams. In both places, Ewbank instituted a patented building program that proved effective. In each place, his skill of judging and handling players was quickly apparent and a predominant factor in his success."

Favre saw little action as a rookie and was traded to the Green Bay Packers the following season in exchange for a first round pick. An injury to the Packers\u2019 incumbent starter Don Majikowski in Week 3 immediately thrust Brett into action. From that point, Favre embarked on a career in which he rewrote the NFL\u2019s record book during his 20-year career.Favre led the Packers to a 9-7 record in 1992, only the team\u2019s second winning season in ten years. He also logged 3,227 yards passing, the first of 18 straight seasons in which he reached the 3000-yard plateau (an NFL record), and exceeded 4,000 yards in six of those seasons. After his breakout campaign, Favre was awarded the first of 11 Pro Bowl selections.The following year Favre guided the Packers to another 9-7 record but this time the team earned a Wild Card berth in the playoffs, the first postseason appearance for Green Bay (excluding the strike shortened 1982 season) since 1972.More success was to come. In 1995, Favre began a three-year stint in which he led the Packers to three straight NFC championship games which resulted in two Super Bowl appearances including a victory in Super Bowl XXXI. He passed for a career-high 4,413 yards in 1995 but Green Bay fell to the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC championship game. His efforts that season earned him the first of three straight NFL Most Valuable Player awards.Favre led the league in touchdown passes for the second of three consecutive seasons in 1996 as he guided the Packers to a 35-21 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. It was the first championship for Green Bay since Super Bowl II. Favre and the Packers nearly repeated as Super Bowl winners but narrowly lost to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII.Favre\u2019s passing prowess continued at a record pace through the years and by the end of 2007, his last in Green Bay, he had supplanted Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino as the career passing leader in attempts, completions, yards, and touchdowns.He played three more seasons with the New York Jets (2008) and the Minnesota Vikings (2009-2010). The 2009 season was one of his finest as he threw for 4,202 and registered a career-high 107.2 passer rating while leading the Vikings to an appearance in the NFC title game.Favre, an NFL ironman who played in a record 299 consecutive games, posted totals of 6,300 completions, 10,169 attempts, 71,838 yards, and 508 touchdowns in his 302-game NFL career."

He first played football at Santa Clara, took three years out for military service during World War II, and then finished up with a pair of All-America seasons at UCLA.Although originally drafted as a defensive back, Rams coaches realized his ball-hawking skills would be best utilized on offense. It was a wise decision. Fears went on to lead the league in receptions in each of his first three NFL seasons. He improved his total each year, setting a new league record with 77 catches in 1949 and then smashing his own mark with 84 in 1950.In a game against the Green Bay Packers that year, Tom caught a then-league record 18 passes. One week later, the Rams defeated the Chicago Bears 24-14 to win the NFL Western Division title and Fears scored all three touchdowns on sensational pass plays of 43, 68, and 27 yards.Although the 6-2, 216-pound Fears did not possess unusual speed, he ran extremely precise patterns, specializing in the buttonhook route, and was absolutely fearless when catching in a crowd. Time and again Tom demonstrated his big-play abilities, but no play was more memorable than his game-winning reception in the 1951 NFL Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns. In the fourth quarter, with the score tied at 17 apiece, Fears grabbed a short 13-yard toss from quarterback Norm Van Brocklin and raced an additional 60 yards for the tie-breaking touchdown and victory. It was the Rams first title since moving from Cleveland following the 1945 season.While one play doesn't make a successful career, in Fears' case, such heroics were standard achievements for nine seasons with the Rams.

And when Van Brocklin resigned a few months later, Finks tapped an obscure CFL coach, Bud Grant, to lead the Vikings.The Bears, who had not won a championship since 1963, hired Finks as general manager and executive vice-president just before the 1974 season. The Bears, under Finks\u2019 leadership, were a playoff team again in 1977 and 1979. He resigned following the 1982 season.In 1986, Finks signed on with the Saints.

On hearing of the signing of Wayne Millner, Ray wired his boss, George Preston Marshall: \"With that big Yankee playing end, please accept my resignation if we do not win the championship this year!\"History shows, however, that while the Redskins did not win, neither did Flaherty resign. Instead he stayed on with the Redskins, who moved to Washington in 1937, for six more years. In all, he led the team to two NFL championships and four divisional titles.He guided the Redskins during the period that the Chicago Bears dominated pro football. Yet, Flaherty's Redskins defeated the Bears two out of three times in NFL title showdowns. Two important football innovations are credited to Flaherty and each played an important role in his two NFL championships.In 1937, Ray introduced the behind-the-line screen pass against the Bears. Redskins quarterback Sammy Baugh threw three touchdown passes against the unprepared Chicago defenses for a 28-21 victory. Later, Ray developed a 1940s version of the two-platoon system. Both units played both ways but one unit emphasized the passing offense while the second platoon featured the ground game. This substitution plan was particularly effective in the 1942 championship year, Ray's last season in Washington.When Ray returned to civilian life after World War II, he opted to join the New York Yankees of the newly formed All-America Football Conference and there he won two straight divisional crowns. He closed out his coaching career in 1949 with the AAFC\u2019s Chicago Hornets. For his entire coaching career, Ray's record shows 80 wins, 37 losses and five ties, for an excellent .676 lifetime winning percentage.

He was excellent on defense and a favorite on offense with leaping, one-hand grabs that netted 67 receptions in two years.When the AAFC disbanded after the 1949 season, Ford was placed in a special draft pool. The Cleveland Browns, who earmarked him for their defensive platoon, quickly grabbed him. It wasn't long before Ford was recognized as the very best of many stars on a unit that allowed the fewest points of any NFL team six of seven years in the 1951-1957 period.Ford developed into such a devastating pass rusher that the Browns changed their whole defensive alignment to take advantage of his rare talents. By using the linebackers behind the two ends and a pair of tackles, Cleveland in effect created the first 4-3 defense. This enabled Ford to line up closer to the ball-handling action and have a better shot at enemy quarterbacks.A serious injury almost ended Ford's career in his first NFL season. When hit by the elbow of Cardinals fullback Pat Harder, Ford suffered a broken nose, two fractured cheekbones and several lost teeth. Len was counted out for the season but plastic surgery, a strenuous rehabilitation program and the use of a specially designed face mask made it possible for Ford to return for the 1950 title game with the Los Angeles Rams. Len responded with one of his finest games to help Cleveland to a razor-thin 30-28 victory. Ford, who recovered 20 opponents' fumbles in nine NFL seasons, was a first- or second-team All-NFL pick seven times. He also played in four consecutive Pro Bowls.

He had determination and talent, however, and soon was excelling as a little man in a big man's game.On offense, he called signals for the linemen and was a battering-ram blocker. On defense, he was a genius at diagnosing enemy plays and a deadly tackler. For seven seasons, Fortmann and Chicago's No. 1 pick in the historic 1936 draft, tackle Joe Stydahar, were a formidable combination on the left side of the powerful Bears line.The Bears were a dominant team during Fortmann's career. From 1936 to 1943, the \u201cMonsters of the Midway\u201d won three NFL championships and took divisional titles on two other occasions, and Fortmann was the top man at his position in pro football.

His 20 touchdown passes in 1929, including four in one game, were both NFL records for years.Following the 1928 season New York Giants owner Tim Mara purchased the Detroit franchise just to secure the services of Friedman. \u00a0 Mara\u2019s decision was based not only on the quarterback\u2019s league-leading performances, but also on his all-important gate appeal. \u00a0 He proved to be an asset in both categories, not only for the Giants, but for the emerging pro league as well. \u00a0 Although very durable, a knee injury coupled with the rigors of serving as an assistant coach at Yale, Friedman\u2019s productivity dropped in 1931. \u00a0 Still the player-coach managed to earn third-team All-NFL honors that year and second-team All-NFL honors in 1933."

He concluded his 11-year tenure with the Browns in 1956 and then was traded to the Detroit Lions for a final season in 1957.The 6-3, 233-pound Gatski, who played three years at Marshall College before joining the U.S. Infantry in World War II, had to survive a grueling training camp tryout to earn a spot on the 1946 Browns roster. Then he had to serve a two-year apprenticeship behind the veteran Mo Scarry before Frank took over the regular center job for good in 1948.Strong, consistent, blessed with a great attitude and exceptional pass blocking abilities, Frank was also durable. He never missed a game or a practice in high school, college or the pros. He was named to the All-NFL honor roll in 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1955 and played as a starting center in the 1956 Pro Bowl. Perhaps because he played at a comparatively obscure position, Gatski was relatively unsung through most of his career. Many of his more publicized teammates on both the Browns and the Lions preceded him into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. However, Frank can claim one signal distinction \u2013 he played in 11 championship games in 12 seasons with his team winning eight times.During his tenure, the Browns won all four AAFC championships and were in the title game their first six years in the NFL. The Browns missed the playoffs in 1956 but Frank earned his eighth championship ring in 1957, when the Lions overwhelmed his old team, 59-14, in Gatski's final game in the NFL."

He began his pro football career the following year as a middle guard in the then-standard five-man defensive front. Two years later, in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, George made a now historic move that permanently changed defensive strategy in the National Football League.On passing plays, George\u2019s job was to bump the center and then drop back. George, noting the Eagles success at completing short passes just over his head, decided to skip the center bump and drop back immediately. Two plays later he caught the first of his 18 pro interceptions. While no one can swear which middle guard in a five-man line first dropped back to play middle linebacker and create the classic 4-3 defense, George is the most popular choice.Certainly he was the first to star at the middle linebacker position. It was his ability to diagnose and react quickly that led the Bears to believe he could move that step or two backwards and become a super middle linebacker \u2013 a demanding position requiring sometimes pass rushing and sometimes pass defense, along with sure tackling, the speed to move from sideline to sideline, the agility to avoid blockers, and a keen sense of anticipation.During the 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s, the Bears were known for their outstanding defensive teams and George was a major part reason for their fame. A ferocious all-out player, he was named All-NFL choice eight times \u2013 seven consecutive seasons (1955-1961) and then an eighth in 1963 when he was the leader of the defensive that figured in the Bears 14-10 championship win over the New York Giants.He was also selected to play in eight consecutive Pro Bowls, 1955-1962. In addition to his eighteen career interceptions, George also recovered nineteen fumbles, and in 1954 scored 25 points on thirteen PATs and four field goals."

In 1953, he even played two ways in an era of one-platoon specialists, averaging almost 50 minutes every game.In 1956, he was the NFL's Most Valuable Player as he paced the Giants to a league championship. Six times he was named first- or second-team All-NFL.

In the Browns' 30-28 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the 1950 NFL Championship Game, Graham threw four touchdown passes.His finest title-game performance came four years later when he scored three touchdowns and threw for a trio of scores in a 56-10 lacing of Detroit. Graham retired after that game but responded to Paul Brown's SOS early in 1955.

        "Bio": "A standout offensive lineman who also served as the reserve punter at the University of Pittsburgh, Russ Grimm easily made the transition from college to the pros. The Washington Redskins selected him in the third round, 69th player overall, of the 1981 National Football League Draft. Originally pegged to play center, the position at which he excelled at Pitt, Grimm was moved to left guard where he earned a starting role as a rookie.The 6'3\", 273-pound Grimm became a steadying force on the Redskins vaunted offensive line of the 1980s that earned the nickname \"The Hogs.\" By his second season in the NFL, Grimm gained much notice from around the league. Teaming with tackle Joe Jacoby, the pair formed what was perhaps the most punishing side of an offensive line in football at the time. With Grimm utilizing his speed and strength, the Redskins rode the success of a dominating running attack all the way to a victory in Super Bowl XVII. In that game, Hall of Fame fullback John Riggins gained a then-record 166 yards. Washington had averaged an astonishing\u00a0198 yards during that season's playoffs.It was in his third pro year, in 1983, that Grimm began reaping the rewards of his efforts. He was selected to the first of four straight Pro Bowls. That season also marked the first of four consecutive years (1983-86) that he earned All-Pro recognition. Grimm was also named All-NFC in each of those seasons.In 1987, Grimm was moved to center in training camp and started five games at the position before he suffered a torn ligament in his left knee that sidelined him until the season finale. The following year, Grimm again suffered cartilage damage to his left knee which forced him to miss 11 games. Although he remained a guiding force on the Redskins front line he continued to battle various injuries through the remainder of his career.Grimm appeared in five NFC championship games during his 11-year, 140-game career. He also helped the Redskins to four Super Bowl appearances including wins in Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. It was after the Redskins win over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVI that Grimm announced his retirement.One of the most feared guards of his era, Grimm was elected to the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 1980s."

Lou, who was one of pro football's finest offensive tackles, particularly in the middle years of his long tenure, preferred to think of himself first as a tackle who just happened to be the Browns' field-goal kicker because he \u201chad the talent.\"Groza was named first- or second-team all-league eight times during his career.

In 1946, 33-man rosters prevented any team from carrying a specialist, but Groza was almost that, doing all of the kicking and playing on the scrimmage line only occasionally.Late in his second season, Lou made \"the first team\" and he didn't give up that cherished status until 1959. He sat out the entire 1960 season with a back injury and then returned in 1961 at the age of 37 for seven more campaigns as a kicker only.In 21 years, \"The Toe,\" as he quickly became known, tallied 1,608 points and for years ranked as the all-time top scorer. His most dramatic kick came in the 1950 National Football League Championship Game, when his 16-yard field goal in the final seconds gave the Browns a 30-28 victory over the Los Angeles Rams."

He used his athletic skills to gain a college education and a satisfying professional career. After playing on Georgia Tech\u2019s national championship team in 1917, Joe signed to play pro football with the Canton Bulldogs in 1919.After the NFL was organized in 1920, Guyon played seven more seasons with six different teams. From 1919 to 1924, Joe teamed with another outstanding Indian halfback, the fabled Jim Thorpe. Both were talented players but the better-known Thorpe grabbed most of the headlines.The paths of the talented Indian pair parted late in the 1924 season when Guyon left the Rock Island Independents to go to the Kansas City Cowboys. Guyon stayed with the Cowboys in 1925 while Thorpe, then 37, moved on to the New York Giants.Two years later in 1927, Guyon became a Giant and he played a major role in leading the New Yorkers to the 1927 NFL championship. Guyon, away from the shadow of Thorpe, enjoyed one of his finest seasons and gained the first significant publicity he had enjoyed since his college days. The 1927 Giants compiled an 11-1-1 record largely on the strength of a superior defensive that allowed only 20 points all season.

It was, however, as a coach that he excelled and was best known. Although Halas coached his Bears for 40 seasons, he stepped away from the coaching ranks three times \u2013 1930-1932, 1942-1945 (to serve in the military), and 1956-1957.Each time a rejuvenated Halas returned to the sidelines to coach and won an NFL championship. Twice, in 1934 and 1942, Halas\u2019 teams had undefeated regular-season records. His 318 regular-season wins and 324 total victories were long-standing NFL records until broken by DON SHULA in 1993.His Chicago Bears teams won six NFL titles, the first coming in 1921 after the Staleys moved to Chicago. George's Bears won three other divisional titles and finished second 15 times. Only six of Halas' 40 teams finished below the .500 mark.As a coach, Halas was first in many ways: the first to hold daily practice sessions, to utilize films of opponents' games for study, to schedule a barnstorming tour, and to have his team's games broadcast on radio. With his players, George maintained tight control. Disobedience and insubordination were not tolerated. Along with Ralph Jones, his coach from 1930 through 1932, and consultant Clark Shaughnessy, Halas perfected the T-formation attack with the man in motion. It was this destructive force that propelled the Bears to their stunning 73-0 NFL title win over Washington in the 1940 NFL Championship Game and sent every other league team scurrying to copy the Halas system."

Hampton was an impact player even as a rookie.

His play earned him the first of his four Pro Bowl invitations. In the nine-game strike-shortened 1982 season, Hampton, playing right end, led the Bears with 9 sacks and was second with 71 tackles.

        "Bio": "Wide receiver Marvin Harrison was the 19th overall choice by the Indianapolis Colts in the 1996 NFL Draft. The Colts obtained the pick in a trade with the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for Jeff George, the number one overall pick in the 1990 draft. Harrison quickly became the number one weapon for the first overall pick in 1998, Peyton Manning. Over the next 13 seasons, Harrison registered staggering numbers as he sprinkled his name throughout the NFL\u2019s record book.The Syracuse grad exhibited his abilities in his first year when he earned All-Rookie honors and led the Colts in receptions (64), receiving yards (836) and total touchdowns (8). His best game that season occurred on the road against the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 15 when he pulled in six receptions for 106 yards and 3 TDs to earn the AFC Player of the Week Award. He matched that three-touchdown effort eight more times during his career.Harrison had a breakout season in 1999 and established himself as one of the NFL\u2019s elite receivers. Teamed with Manning, he racked up 115 receptions for a league-leading 1,663 yards and 12 TDs. The performance set off a remarkable string of eight straight years with 1,000 or more yards receiving and 10 or more touchdowns. It was also the first of four straight years with 100 or more receptions. His best NFL season may have been 2002 when he shattered the NFL single-season record for receptions (143) and had a career-high 1,722 yards and 11 TDs.In 2004, Harrison tied his career-high for touchdowns in a season with 15 (he set the mark in 2001) on top of 86 catches for 1,113 yards. His effort was a major factor in the Colts\u2019 march to Super Bowl XLI where the team defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 in a rain-soaked matchup in South Florida.A member of the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 2000s, Harrison retired following the 2008 season with 1,102 career receptions for 14,580 yards and 128 touchdowns. The eight-time Pro Bowler finished second to Jerry Rice in league annals in career receptions, most consecutive games with a reception (190) and most career 100-yards games (59). His yardage total ranked him fourth all-time and his career TDs (128) were ninth on the all-time list at the time of his retirement.Harrison, who was a six-time All-Pro and an eight-time All-AFC selection, achieved most of his success with Manning as his quarterback. In 158 games together, the duo connected on 953 passes for 12,766 yards and 112 TDs, the most completions, yards and touchdowns by a tandem in NFL history.  "

        "Bio": "\u00a0When Bob Hayes arrived on the pro football scene in 1965, he had already earned athletic stardom having won a pair of gold medals in the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. His medal-winning performance in the 100 meters competition earned him the title \"World's Fastest Human.\" But for the Dallas Cowboys, the team that drafted him in the seventh round of the 1964 NFL Draft, the question lingered, \"could a track man succeed in a contact sport like pro football?\" The answer came quickly as the rookie's 46 receptions for 1,003 yards led all Cowboys receivers.Hayes demonstrated time and again that he possessed tremendous football skills and instincts that helped him to develop into a terrific NFL wide receiver. Still, his world class speed was a major factor in his and the Cowboys offensive successes. \"Bullet Bob\" terrorized defensive backs and demanded the kind of deep double coverage rarely seen in the NFL at that time. It is often said that the bump and run defense was developed in an attempt to slow down the former Florida A&M running back.\"I know one thing, and I played with him,\" commented Hall of Fame tight end Mike Ditka, \"he changed the game. He made defenses and defensive coordinators work hard to figure out what you had to do to stop him.\"\rHall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach knew firsthand the value of the speedy receiver. \"He can explode and make things happen,\" he offered. \"As long as Bobby is in the lineup the other team has to make adjustments it doesn't normally make.\"St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame safety Larry Wilson played against Hayes on a number of occasions. He observed that the difference between Hayes and other track men turned football players was that he had the ability to use his speed \"in a football sense,\" rather than just trying to run fast as he could. \"He had several speeds, all of them fast,\" explained Wilson. \"But defensive backs had to figure out which one he was using and which one he was going to use.\"Four times Hayes was named first- or second-team All-NFL. Three times he led the Cowboys in receptions, including back-to-back titles in 1965-66 when he caught a total of 110 passes for more than 2,200 yards and 25 touchdowns. For his 11-year career, Hayes accumulated 7,414 yards and 71 touchdowns. His 71 career touchdown receptions remain a Cowboys' club record."

He faced the Chicago Tigers in his first game and played well enough that the management asked to join the team on a permanent basis.In 1922, while playing against George Halas, the player-coach of the Chicago Bears, Healey dominated his opponent so thoroughly Halas decided he had to have this player on his team. After the game, he bought Healey for $100. Healey was elated to get a raise to $100 a game but was most excited that the Bears had a clubhouse. ''At Rock Island,\" Ed explained, \"we had no showers and seldom a trainer. At Wrigley Field, we had a nice warm place to dress and nice warm showers.\"Throughout his NFL career, Healey was a true warrior. Halas often called him \"the most versatile tackle in history.\" He was an all-league pick five times during his eight-year NFL career. Blessed with good speed for a tackle, Healey was involved in at least two unforgettable plays as a Bear. In 1924, \"Big Ed\" ran more than 30 yards to nail his own teammate, who had run the wrong way with an intercepted pass, just short of the wrong goal line.Two years later during the Bears' long barnstorming tour that featured the famous Red Grange, Healey made a touchdown-saving play before 60,000 fans, a play he called his greatest pro football thrill. Los Angeles All-Stars running ace George Wilson broke through the Bears line and into the open, but Healey hurdled several of his own teammates and caught Wilson from behind after a long chase."

He was the team captain for 10 seasons.\"Cappy\" could do everything expected of a center and a linebacker and quite a bit more. Mel was one of the few NFL stars who had the speed and agility to contain Green Bay's premier receiver, Don Hutson, by bottling him up on the sidelines so he could not maneuver into the open. Although Mel was thoroughly aggressive and coldly ferocious when it came to blocking and tackling, he was a gentleman player. He rarely lost his temper.Hein led Washington State to a Rose Bowl bid in 1930 and was named to Grantland Rice's All-America team. Yet Mel had to write to three NFL teams offering his services in 1931. Providence bit first, offering $135 a game. Hein signed and mailed the Steam Roller contract. Then he learned that he could get $150 from the Giants so he hastily wired the Providence postmaster, described the letter he had sent and asked him to return it.

In the Canton Repository the next day, the Henry acquisition was banner-headline news while the birth of the new pro football league was relegated to page three.It\u2019s understandable that the newspaper editor could not have grasped the significance of the league meeting. Under any circumstance, Henry was an established superstar, a valuable addition to the Canton team and worthy of headline attention. At first glance, however, Henry did not look like a football player.Seemingly both short and pudgy, he looked soft and fat at 5-11 in and weighing 245. But his looks were truly deceiving. Henry had the swift reflexes of a man-eating tiger. Good-natured, easy-going and prone to laughter off the field, he was an uncompromising competitor on the gridiron. For the Bulldogs, who won NFL championships in both 1922 and 1923, Henry was a major contributor. Among his game heroics was a 40-yard field goal that tied Akron, 3-3, and preserved Canton's unbeaten season in 1922.Henry did much more than just block and tackle with monotonous efficiency. Versatile, he was even used occasionally on a \"tackle over tackle\" play. \"Fats,\" as he was also known, was a superior punter, placekicker and dropkicker and, for many years held a spot in the NFL record book for his kicking exploits.The multi-talented tackle reportedly once dropkicked a 45-yard field goal and boomed a 94-yard punt. \u201cFats\u201d might even have been more devastating on defense.

That year, the Green Bay Packer quarterback won the league passing title, something he would do again in 1934 and 1936.Arnie threw a touchdown pass to give the Packers a 7-0 victory in the first game of his rookie 1930 season. The Packers won NFL titles in both 1930 and 1931 and remained in a perpetual contending position throughout Herber's 11-year tenure. His passes were always a dominating factor but he could also run, catch passes, and punt with the very best.The arrival of end Don Hutson in 1935 gave pro football its first lethal quarterback-receiver tandem. In Hutson\u2019s second game in the NFL, against the Chicago Bears, he teamed with Herber for an 83-yard touchdown reception. In 1935, the Herber-to-Hutson duo connected 18 times for 420 yards and seven touchdowns. Although an injury in 1937 reduced his effectiveness some, the Herber-to-Hutson mystic continued until Herber retired in 1940.With many players serving in the military during World War II, the New York Giants brought Herber out of retirement for two more years in 1944 and 1945. He then retired for good with the reputation of being pro football\u2019s great long-distance passer.Herber was a basketball and football star at Green Bay's West High School who sold game programs as a teenager so that he could see the Packers play. He eventually migrated to tiny Regis College in Denver, but he soon was back in Green Bay, where he worked as a handyman in the Packers\u2019 clubhouse when coach Curly Lambeau decided to give the inexperienced player a tryout.

He was always conjuring up new gimmicks to foil the opposition.One of his special plays called for a jump pass from fullback Bronko Nagurski. Hewitt would in turn lateral to another end, Bill Karr, racing toward the goal line. It was this play that gave the Bears a victory in the NFL's first championship game in 1933, a 23-21 win over the New York Giants.On defense, Hewitt became the first player to make the masses take their eyes off the football just to watch him stymie the opponent. Because he had a jet-propulsion start at the snap of the ball, the fans tabbed him \"The Offside Kid,\" because they couldn't fathom anyone reacting so quickly without being offside.Equally impressive was his tackling and his uncanny knack of diagnosing enemy plays. Hewitt was the first to admit he wasn't much of a player either in high school or at the University of Michigan. Once he reached the NFL, it was a different story. He was named all-league as a rookie by one major publication and repeated the honor in 1933, 1934,1936,1937, and 1938. The last two times he was selected as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles."

        "Bio": "Ken Houston excelled as the premier free safety of his era in a 14-year span that began with the 1967 Houston Oilers who drafted him in the ninth round of the AFL-NFL draft. He earned a starter\u2019s role by the third game of his rookie season. Two weeks later, in a game against the New York Jets, he scored two touchdowns, one on a 71-yard blocked field goal attempt, and the other on a 43-yard interception return.After excelling for six years with the Oilers, Ken was traded to the Redskins for five veteran players in 1973. The Redskins once referred to Houston as \"pro football's most underrated super-star,\" but his capabilities were widely recognized. He won all-league acclaim with the Oilers in 1969 and 1971, and then was either All-Pro or All-NFC with the Redskins every year from 1973 to 1979.He was selected for either the AFL All-Star game or the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl 12 straight seasons from 1968 through 1979. With a long, fluid stride, he had excellent speed and quickness. His 6-3, 197-pound frame made him an ideal pass defender. Yet his lean, muscular body helped him to become a punishing tackler.Once he got his hands on the ball, he was a talented runner. Even before he finished his tenure with the Oilers, Houston had assured himself of a spot in the NFL record book by returning nine interceptions for touchdowns. He also tied two other records with four TDs on steals in one season and two interception touchdowns in a single game. Altogether, he stole 49 passes and returned them 898 yards. He also recovered 21 fumbles and scored 12 touchdowns, nine on interceptions and one each on a punt return, a fumble return, and a blocked field goal return."

The positive result ignited a spark to give the game one more try at the highest level.\u00a0\r\u201cI went back (to pro football) because I decided there were better things to do than run a gas station,\u201d Howley told a reporter years later.\u00a0\rNeither he nor the Dallas Cowboys, who obtained his rights from the Bears for two future draft picks, regretted the decision.\u00a0\rFully healed, Howley became a model of durability in his second round in the NFL.

It was an awesome combination for a tackle \u2013 size and speed.Hubbard played college football at two relatively small schools, Centenary College and Geneva College. But, when he turned pro, he went to the game\u2019s biggest city, New York. The Giants, however, were well stocked at the tackle position, so the big man from the small schools was moved to the end position on offense and linebacker on defense. For the next two years, 1927 and 1928, the Giants teamed Cal with another future Hall of Fame lineman, Steve Owen.The addition of big Cal made a good Giants defense great. New York posted 10 shutouts in 13 games in 1927 and allowed only 20 points for the season while winning their first NFL title. Hubbard earned all-league acclaim both seasons with New York.In 1929, at his request, Cal was traded to Green Bay where he liked the small town atmosphere. Packers\u2019 coach Earl (Curly) Lambeau was building a championship organization in Green Bay. Lambeau moved the versatile Hubbard back to the tackle spot. The Packers won NFL championships three straight years \u2013 1929, 1930, and 1931. Cal enjoyed his best years with the Packers from 1929-1933 and 1935. During that time he earned first-team all-league honors as a guard in 1929 and at tackle in 1931, 1932, and 1933.During the summers in Green Bay, Hubbard began umpiring baseball games. In 1936, he began a new career as an American League umpire. He became almost as famous as a baseball umpire as he had been as a football player. In 1958 he was appointed umpire-in-chief of the American League. Hubbard is the only person to be enshrined in both the Baseball and Pro Football Hall of Fames."

At the age of 24, he appeared on a Time Magazine cover. He was the subject of a television special, '\u201dThe Violent World of Sam Huff.\u201d Almost overnight, he became the symbol of the new glamour era for defensive football.Sam was flooded with honors. He was named All-NFL three times, picked as the NFL's top linebacker in 1959 and selected for five Pro Bowls, four of them while he was with the Giants. The relatively new middle linebacker's job called for someone big enough to handle the power runners, fast enough to overhaul swift halfbacks and agile enough to protect against the passer.To these attributes, Huff added a true love for the game and a unique ability to diagnose and disrupt the opponents' plays. Sam was best known for his hand-to-hand combat near the scrimmage line and for his duels with the likes of Jim Brown and Jim Taylor but he was also adept at pass defense. His 30 pass steals attest to that facet of his game.In spite of his abundant talents, fate had to intervene several times to keep him out of the West Virginia coal mines. When Sam was a junior at Farmington High School, the West Virginia University coach came to town to look at a hot prospect but wound up recruiting Sam instead.At the end of Huff's college career, Giants scout Al DeRogatis came to look at an All-America guard named Bruce Bosley. \"Bosley is great,\" DeRogatis wired back, \"but there's another guard here who will be even greater. His name is Sam Huff.\" Huff was a third-round draft pick in 1956 but, once in camp, things turned sour. Coach Jim Lee Howell agreed that Sam was a quality athlete but admitted he didn't know where to play him. Discouraged, Sam left camp and headed for the airport. There he was intercepted by assistant coach Vince Lombardi who lectured him on the merits of guts and determination and coaxed him back to camp.Shortly after Sam's return, fate stepped in a final time. Ray Beck, the regular middle linebacker, was injured and Huff, in the emergency, got a chance to fill in. He did the job so well that Beck retired and Sam never had to worry about a regular football job \u2013 or the coal mine \u2013 again."

His outstanding play earned him NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year honors.\rAlthough it didn\u2019t become an official NFL statistic until after he retired, Humphrey is credited with 122 career sacks.

He was also named first- or second-team All-NFC seven times and was selected to play in six Pro Bowls.Durable, Claude missed only two games in his first seven seasons, but in 1975 he suffered what many thought would be a career-ending knee injury that sidelined him for the entire season. A fierce competitor Humphrey battled his way back in 1976 and delivered an impressive season of play. Again he led the Falcons as he posted a career-best 15 sacks. His teammates, impressed by his hard work and outstanding play, voted him the team\u2019s Most Valuable Player.Humphrey temporarily retired from pro football after four games of the 1978 season. In 1979, the Falcons traded him to the Eagles for two fourth-round draft picks. In Philadelphia the rested defensive end seemed to pick up right where he left off in Atlanta.

        "Bio": "In 1959, a young man, totally frustrated in his repeated attempts to gain a franchise in the National Football League, hit upon an idea. The young man was Lamar Hunt, a 26-year-old sports-minded, civic-minded individual who called Dallas home, and his idea, simply, was to form a new professional football league to rival the NFL.Lamar quickly approached other people who might be interested in owning franchises in a new league and, within seven months, the American Football League was born. The new league was the subject of many a joke in the early days of its existence but its eventual David-and-Goliath-like success in its costly survival battle with the established NFL did more to permanently change the pro football scene than any other event in a half-century of organized pro football activity.It would be incorrect to say that everything good that happened to the AFL before, during and after the bitter fight with the NFL was Hunt's doing. He was, however, a leader in many of the forceful and daring moves his league made. Once merger talks were under way, Lamar eventually played a significant role in bringing about the agreement that gave the AFL totally equality in the pro football world. By the example of having a solid team and a solid organization right from the start, Lamar gave the AFL additional strength.His original Dallas Texans team had to battle head-to-head with the newly established Cowboys and, even though the battle was a dead-even affair, Hunt, after three years, wisely moved his team to Kansas City. There the Chiefs became known as one of pro football's finest organizations, both off and on the field. The eventual merger between the AFL-NFL and the resulting successes of pro football are more than even Lamar himself could have thought possible."

When Hutson retired in 1945 after 11 superb seasons, he held 18 NFL records, including 488 career receptions.That was 200 more than his closest competitor. Hutson invented modern pass receiving. He created Z-outs, buttonhooks, hook-and-gos\u00a0and a whole catalog of moves and fakes. Although he had been an All-America at Alabama in 1934, there were plenty who doubted the skinny speedster could stand the pace of pro football. But it wasn't long before his mere presence on the field had changed the defensive concept of the game.Don could outmaneuver and outrace virtually every defender in the league. He led the NFL in receiving in eight of his 11 seasons and in scoring five consecutive\u00a0years. Twice, in 1941 and 1942, he was named the league\u2019s MVP.Like everyone in the days before free substitution, Hutson was a 60-minute player who spent most of his career as a very fine safety on defense. In his final six seasons, he swiped 30 opposing passes. Often after scoring a touchdown, he would kick the extra point. In one quarter of a 1945 game, he caught four touchdown passes and kicked five PATs for an amazing 29 points.Had it not been for a unique decision by NFL President Joe Carr, Hutson might never have become a landmark pass-catcher. After college, Don signed contracts with both the pass-minded Packers and the NFL\u2019s Brooklyn Dodgers, a team that rarely passed. Carr ruled the contract with the earliest postmark would be honored. The Packers' contract was postmarked 8:30 a.m., 17 minutes earlier than the Dodgers' pact. Thus Hutson became a Packer."

He became the first rookie wide receiver to start a season opener for Dallas in more than 20 years. He caught his first of 65 career touchdowns in that game. Irvin's 20.4 yard per catch average during his rookie year led the NFC.Early in his career, Irvin and the Cowboys suffered through some lean years.

He ranked sixth in career reception yardage.The Houston Oilers targeted Joiner for the defensive backfield when they picked the 5-11, 180-pounder from Grambling in the fourth round of the 1969 AFL-NFL Draft.

Yet had it not been for the chance observation of two Rams scouts viewing films of an opponent, he might never have had a chance to play pro football. When the scouts noted that the 6-4, 272-pound tackle was outrunning the backs they were scouting, they recommended Jones as a sleeper pick.His college background consisted of a year at South Carolina State in 1958 followed by a year of inactivity in 1959 and a final season at Mississippi Vocational in 1960. Originally, the Rams weren't certain which platoon would be best for Jones but the Deacon quickly earned his niche as a defensive end and, for most of a decade, he teamed with tackle Merlin Olsen to give Los Angeles a perennial All-Pro left side of the defensive line.Jones won unanimous all-league honors six straight years from 1965 through 1970. He also played in seven straight Pro Bowls, 1965-1971, and was selected to an eighth in 1973. In both 1967 and 1968, he was chosen the top defensive player in the NFL by one major news service.In 1972, Jones was included in a multi-player trade with the San Diego Chargers. He was an instant success with his new team, leading all Chargers' defensive linemen in tackles and winning a berth on the AFC Pro Bowl squad. He also was named San Diego's defensive captain. He concluded his career with the Washington Redskins in 1974. The extremely durable and dedicated Jones missed just five games of a possible 196 regular-season encounters in 14 NFL campaigns."

For most of those years, he was the Bears' offensive captain. Jones possessed size, quickness and strength. He was one of the first pro football players to concentrate on a weight-lifting program to build him into playing condition.

When the Bears needed help on their defensive unit in 1962, assistant coach George Allen decided that Jones, with size and game intelligence, could help at defensive tackle.Jones played both ways in 1962 and then switched to defensive tackle permanently in 1963. That year, the Bears marched to the NFL championship on the strength of an outstanding defensive platoon. After his 12th season in 1965, Bears coach George Halas agreed, as a favor to Jones, to trade him to the Washington Redskins so that he could play a final season near his home in Rockville, Maryland.

A two-way guard who was larger, stronger, and tougher than most of his opponents, he began his storied NFL career as a true \u201cIron Man\u201d with the Duluth Eskimos.The Eskimos, led by Hall of Fame fullback Ernie Nevers, played 29 games in 1926 including 28 of them on the road. Linemen seldom make the record books, but \u201cBig Kies,\u201d as he was known, helped put Nevers there when the two played for the Chicago Cardinals.On November 20, 1929, in a game against the Chicago Bears, Nevers scored six touchdowns and accounted for 40 points. Walt helped pave the way with his classic power blocking. Keisling, who was named to the NFL\u2019s all-league team in 1929, 1930, and 1932, attended little St. Thomas College in his hometown of St. Paul, Minnesota, even though he was recruited by the larger, better-known Notre Dame. As a pro he played in five different cities.From 1926 through 1938, Kiesling performed for Duluth, Pottsville, both Chicago teams \u2013 Cardinals and Bears, Green Bay and Pittsburgh. Although he suffered through more than his fair share of losses, Keisling did play as a member of the 1934 Bears, who went through the regular season undefeated, and the 1936 Packers, who were NFL champions.In 1939 Keisling got his first head coaching opportunity with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who in 1940 changed their name to Steelers. He also co-coached the merged Pittsburgh-Philadelphia and Pittsburgh-Chicago Cardinals combined teams during World War II. Following the 1944 season, Keisling left the coaching ranks, only to return again in 1954 for another three-year stint with the Steelers. Although the team posted three losing seasons, it earned a reputation for rugged, hard-hitting football \u2013 much the same as its coach had earned as a player."

However, in 1938, when Hall of Fame tackle Frank \u201cBruiser\u201d Kinard began his pro career, that\u2019s exactly how much he weighed. Even in his final season, and still playing the big man's position of tackle, he tipped the scales at just 216 pounds. But his play was as his name implies \u2013 bruising.Kinard earned a host of accolades during the nine years he played pro football, including All-NFL recognition from 1938 through 1944 as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers/Tigers team. In 1946, after a one-year hiatus due to military service, Bruiser returned to pro football as a member of the New York Yankees of the newly formed All-America Football Conference. That same year, he became the first pro football player to earn All-League honors in both leagues.Kinard was a two-time All-America at the University of Mississippi when he was drafted in the third round by the Dodgers in 1938. It was a year abounding with outstanding rookies but only two, Kinard and Byron \"Whizzer' White, made the All-NFL team. Kinard had a burning desire to play and he played for keeps.He had outstanding speed for a tackle and his admirers, of whom there were many, insist that he would have been outstanding at any position. On offensive plays, and particularly the Dodgers\u2019 patented \u201cshovel pass,\u201d Kinard was the key blocker. On defense, he was a crushing tackler.The Bruiser was tough and durable even in the rough-and-tumble competition of pro football. He rarely needed a rest and near-60-minute performances were the rule, rather than the exception. He missed just one game due to injury and, even then, it was doctor's orders, not a lack of willingness to play that kept Bruiser on the sideline."

Others will tell you he was one of history's truly great punters. Still others say it was his breakaway ability on punt returns that set him apart from all the rest.In reality, each assessment is correct because the multi-talented Texas A&M product did all of those things superbly well during his 11 years with the Lions. There is no question that Yale's defensive play was exceptional. A fixture at right safety throughout his career, he was named to the All-NFL team five times and played in nine Pro Bowls. His career mark showed 50 interceptions and he might well have had many more had not opposition quarterbacks avoided throwing in his area.Still those who remember Lary as a superb punter have plenty of reason to do so. His career average of 44.3 yards on 503 punts places him among the best ever. He won three NFL punting titles and missed a fourth by a razor-thin margin. \"Kicking from the end zone, Yale invariably put the ball across midfield with enough hang time to let us cover the kick,\" team captain and Hall of Fame linebacker Joe Schmidt recalled. \"He made our defense look good because he always gave us room to work.\"While Lary's outstanding exploits might be remembered in different ways, all who saw him play undoubtedly would agree that he was a rare find, the kind that comes along only once in a generation. Comparatively small at 5-11 and 185 pounds but armed with a big heart and great ability, he did much to make the Lions a championship team."

        "Bio": "Dante Lavelli, a quarterback in high school and a halfback as an Ohio State freshman, was switched to end by Buckeye coach Paul Brown before his sophomore season. Yet, when Dante joined the newly formed Cleveland Browns in 1946, injuries and a long stint in the U. S. Army had limited his college experience to just three games.To make the Browns, he had to beat out four more experienced and highly regarded candidates. But Dante not only prevailed, he led the league in receptions and won All-AAFC honors in his rookie season. He also caught the winning touchdown pass in the first AAFC championship game between the Browns and the New York Yankees.There were many more high moments in Lavelli's career. He was All-AAFC again in 1947 and, when the Browns moved to the NFL, he was all-league twice more and a starter in three of the first five Pro Bowl games. In the 1950 NFL Championship Game, Dante caught 11 passes, then a record, and scored two touchdowns as the Browns edged the Los Angeles Rams, 30-28.Lavelli was a favorite target of the Browns\u2019 great quarterback, Otto Graham. All but 20 of Dante's 386 career receptions came while Otto was at the Cleveland helm. Like any great pass-catch team, the two spent long hours learning the other's every habit. Dante was a dedicated pattern-runner but once there was a hint things weren't going right, he preferred to take off down the field and yell for the ball. More than once, his penetrating voice provided a homing signal for Graham and the combination clicked for a long touchdown. What set Lavelli apart from all other receivers were his great hands. When Dante went up for a pass in a crowd, you could be sure \"Gluefingers\" would come down with the ball."

        "Bio": "Bobby Layne, during his 15 pro football seasons, was a free-spirited All-NFL caliber quarterback who did well statistically but was exceptional in the intangibles \u2013 leadership, determination, competitiveness, and guts.Layne left pro football with a legend that may never be exactly duplicated. Bobby's story deals with sterling accomplishments on the field but also with his penchant for enjoying every moment off the field, even if that meant on occasion a big night on the town just hours before a crucial game. While it\u2019s likely some of Layne's off-the-field activities have been exaggerated, there is no question he did not always subscribe to the general rules of team behavior.So it may be that Layne's pro football success hinged on the relationship he developed with a wise and understanding coach, Raymond \"Buddy\" Parker, who understood what made Bobby tick. The two combined their talents to produce the most successful years in Detroit Lions history.The Lions won divisional crowns in 1952, 1953, and 1954, and NFL titles in 1952 and 1953. In both title game victories, Layne and the Lions defeated the Cleveland Browns. In the 1953 game Bobby enjoyed his greatest and certainly most famous afternoon. The Browns held a 16-10 advantage with 4:10 left to play. Layne coolly directed the team on an 80-yard touchdown drive that combined with Doak Walker\u2019s extra point kick, gave the Lions a 17-16 win.In 1957, Parker left the Lions to coach the Pittsburgh Steelers. Layne and the Lions won the NFL championship that season. One year later, Layne joined Parker in Pittsburgh through a trade. The Parker-Layne duo provided the Steelers with some of their finest seasons up to that time. Bobby Layne was a never-say-die competitor.

During his 13-year career, Long, a member of the NFL\u2019s All-Decade team of the 1980s, recorded 84 career sacks, not including 7.5 sacks in 1981 before the sack was an official NFL statistic."

        "Bio": "Ronnie Lott, an All-America from Southern California, was the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 first round draft pick and the eighth player chosen overall in the 1981 National Football League Draft. The 6-0, 203-pound defensive back made an immediate impression and was named the starting left cornerback from his first day in training camp.In his first NFL season, Lott led a young secondary that helped the 49ers to win Super Bowl XVI. He became the second rookie in NFL history to return three interceptions for touchdowns. His outstanding play resulted in his finishing second to another defensive standout, Lawrence Taylor, for Rookie of the Year honors.Known for his hard-hitting style, Lott was used at both left and right cornerback positions and as a free and strong safety during his 14-year career. The versatile defensive back earned 10 Pro Bowl invitations at three different positions \u2013 cornerback, free safety, and strong safety. It was, however, at free safety, where he had the freedom to cover the whole field, that he may have been most effective.In 1986, he played 14 games at the free safety position before an injury sidelined him for the final two games of the season. Still, he led the league with a career-most 10 interceptions, recorded 77 tackles, three forced fumbles and two quarterback sacks. It was perhaps his finest season. During his career with the 49ers (1981-1990), Los Angeles Raiders (1991-1992), and the New York Jets (1993-1994) Lott recorded 63 career interceptions and twice led the league.A complete player, he surpassed the 1,000-career tackle mark in 1993, and had five seasons of at least 100 tackles. In his ten seasons with the 49ers, San Francisco won eight NFC Western Division titles and four Super Bowls. In 20 playoff contests (all starts), he recorded nine interceptions, 89 tackles, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and two touchdowns.It has been said that Lott had the uncanny ability of being able to sense the direction a play was about to take and then somehow disrupt it. \u201cHe\u2019s like a middle linebacker playing safety,\u201d Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry once remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s devastating. He may dominate the secondary better than anyone I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Named All-Pro eight times, All-NFC six times, and All-AFC once, Lott was also named to the NFL\u2019s 75th Anniversary Team."

        "Bio": "Sid Luckman, in his 12 seasons with the Chicago Bears, became the first successful T-formation quarterback. One game in Luckman's second season, the 1940 NFL title game, which saw the Bears defeat the Washington Redskins, 73-0, showcased the explosive possibilities of the T attack.\u00a0 Almost immediately, many other pro teams began to adopt the new formation.Bears\u2019 owner and coach, George Halas, first presented Sid with a Bears T-formation playbook when he was practicing for the College All-Star game in 1939. Astonished and somewhat alarmed by the complexities of the new system, Sid was not an instant success. He fumbled frequently, had trouble with handoffs, and in general flunked his first T test. Halas shifted Luckman to halfback for a while before making another effort, which, on the second try, paid dividends.Not all teams had the success with the T-formation that the Bears enjoyed. Chicago won four NFL championships, just missed a fifth, and Luckman was a major reason for the success. The crafty quarterback was named first- or second-team all-league from 1940 through 1948 and won the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player honors in 1943.Although Sid may be best remembered for the 73-0 victory over the Redskins, because the Bears went ahead so early in the game, he actually had to pass only six times, completing four for 102 yards and a touchdown.Apparently, just the threat of Luckman and the T was enough to keep defenses off balance. Luckman had many more outstanding games but two, both in 1943, stand out above the rest. On November 14, Sid Luckman Day at the Polo Grounds, he passed for a record-tying seven touchdowns in a 56-7 win over the New York Giants. Later that year, in the championship game against the Redskins, he threw for 276 yards and five touchdowns in a 41-21 triumph."

Lyman was no stranger to Chamberlin, who was also a Nebraska alumnus.Chamberlin\u2019s recruit went on to star with the Bulldogs during their back-to-back undefeated seasons of 1922 and 1923. The following season the Canton franchise was sold and several Canton players, including Lyman, moved on to Cleveland, where the Cleveland Bulldogs captured the 1924 NFL title. Lyman split the 1925 season between a new Canton franchise and the Frankford Yellowjackets.Following the 1925 season he joined the Chicago Bears during that team\u2019s famous cross-country barnstorming tour that featured Red Grange. Lyman remained with the Bears for the rest of his career that ended almost as it had begun. The Bears won the NFL title in 1933 and a divisional crown in 1934, Lyman\u2019s final season.Many pro football historians believe that the constant shifting by defensive players before each play in modern professional football can be traced back to Lyman, who regularly resorted to similar ploys. His sliding, shifting style of defensive line play confused his opponents and made him one of the most respected players of his time. Lyman explained that the idea of shifting was an instinctive move to fool a blocker. He had a unique ability to diagnose a play and many times he would make his move just as the ball was snapped.Whether it was luck or a result of his outstanding play, Lyman experienced just one losing season during his 16 seasons of high school, college, and professional football. A contributor to the end, Bears coach George Halas insisted Lyman was stronger and tougher during his last two seasons than when he first joined the team eight years earlier."

During the years that Mack played, the Rams enjoyed 12 winning seasons in 13 and compiled a .720 won-lost record (129-48-7). They won their division eight times and wound up in four NFC championship games.The Los Angeles team was loaded with outstanding talent but Mack, as the youthful leader of an excellent offensive line, was one of the most honored of all Rams. The 6-3, 250-pound Mack earned the first of 11 Pro Bowl invitations after his second season in 1967. From that year through his final 1978 campaign, Tom missed earning a Pro Bowl spot only following the 1976 season.

Olsen ranked first with 14 Pro Bowl appearances and is followed by Jim Otto with 12. Mack was also all-pro or All-NFC nine times in a ten-year span from 1969 through 1978. As was the case with the Pro Bowl invitation, he missed All-NFC acclaim only in 1976.An All-America at Michigan in 1965, Mack was the No. 1 pick of the Rams in the 1966 NFL Draft. Tom, who was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on November 1, 1943, was one of only two rookies to survive the entire season on George Allen\u2019s veteran-dominated squad. Tom got a starting chance in the fifth game when starter Don Chuy was injured.

Mackey was not like other tight ends of his day, who were typically thought of as just another tackle on the line of scrimmage. John added another dimension to the position. His breakaway speed made him a legitimate long-distance threat. In 1966 for instance, six of his nine touchdown receptions came on plays of 51, 57, 64, 79, 83 and 89 yards.Even though leg and knee injuries combined to cut short his career, he was a durable performer who missed only one game in 10 years. Mackey started every game as a rookie and then became the only first-year star to be picked for that year's Pro Bowl. He also played in four other Pro Bowls during the 1960s.

As a rookie, he caught 35 passes for 726 yards and a career high 20.7-yard average. That year, the Colts also utilized his speed as a kickoff return specialist and he averaged 30.1 yards on nine returns.

In his first year at the Raiders' helm, Madden earned American Football League Coach of the Year honors as he led the team to a 12-1-1 record and an AFL Western Division title.Madden coached the Raiders for 10 seasons, posting a regular season record of 103 wins, 32 losses and 7 ties. During that time, he guided the team to seven Western Division titles, including five in a row from 1972 to 1976. Under Madden's guidance, Oakland never experienced a losing season. Madden's Raiders made eight playoff appearances, including a 37-31 six-quarter AFC Divisional Playoff win over the Baltimore Colts in 1977. Perennial winners, the team never finished with fewer than 8 wins in the then-14 game season (8-4-2 in 1970, 1971).Six times in 10 seasons, Oakland recorded 10 or more victories. In 1976, the coach guided his team to a near-perfect 13-1 record to win the AFC Western Division. The success continued in the postseason with wins over New England in the divisional playoff game and a commanding 24-7 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. Madden and the Raiders capped the 1976 season with a 32-14 win over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl XI. Between the 1976 and 1977 seasons, the Raiders won 17 games in a row, one short of the then-NFL record for consecutive wins.Madden's .759 regular season winning percentage ranks as highest among coaches with 100 career victories. Only Hall of Fame coaches George Halas and Curly Lambeau had reached 100 career wins at an earlier age.Before coaching in Oakland, Madden was the defensive coordinator at San Diego State, from 1964-1966, where the Aztecs were ranked first among small colleges with a 26-4 record. From 1960-1963 he coached at Hancock Junior College in Santa Maria, California. Madden started on both offense and defense as a player for California Polytechnic College at San Luis Obispo in 1957 and 1958, and was voted to the All-Conference team.

Renamed the Redskins in 1933 and moved to Washington in 1937, Marshall's teams, particularly in the 1936-45 decade, were very successful. They won NFL championships in 1937 and 1942 and divisional titles four other times during that period.But as successful as Marshall's teams were, the flamboyant owner left his biggest mark in areas not directly associated with the team on the field. In the nation\u2019s capital, Marshall organized the Redskins marching band and spectacular halftime shows, introduced cheerleaders, began a radio network that carried games throughout the South, and led thousands of supporters on pilgrimages to rival cities.The energetic leader was also a force in improving the playing rules to open up the game and make it more crowd-pleasing. He championed the decision in 1933 to split the NFL into two divisions, with a playoff game to determine the title, and the liberalization of the forward pass rule. Marshall was totally involved in all aspects of his team\u2019s operation and endured his share of criticism for not integrating his team until being forced to do so in 1962.At his funeral in 1969, then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle summed up the master showman's unusual gift to the NFL. \"Mr. Marshall was an outspoken foe of the status quo when most were content with it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all beneficiaries of what his dynamic personality helped shape over more than three decades.\""

He won a bronze medal in the 400-meter race and a\u00a0silver medal from the 1,600-meter relay.

In his first exhibition game, George returned a punt 75 yards for a touchdown with just seconds remaining to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers. In the 1940 regular-season opener, he ran back a kickoff 93 yards and threw a touchdown pass in a 41-10 Bears victory over arch-rival Green Bay.In the historic 73-0 rout of the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship Game, McAfee contributed a 35-yard interception return for a touchdown.

George, whether running wide or up the middle, either as a pass receiver or a decoy, was known as \"One-Play McAfee,\" and a constant headache to the opposition.

That year he earned the first of six trips to the Pro Bowl, before being called into military service.The Baltimore Colts who acquired his rights before the start of the 1953 season, traded him to the Cleveland Browns in a massive 15-player deal. Even though the Browns knew Mike would not be available for a full year, he was the key man in the trade. Coach Paul Brown always considered it one of his wisest personnel moves.In his first season in Cleveland, McCormack, a former University of Kansas star and Chicago native, was asked to fill the middle guard position that had been vacated by the retiring Bill Willis on the defensive unit. It was a tall order, considering Willis would himself be elected to the Hall of Fame. McCormack, not surprisingly, was up to the challenge.He quickly became an important factor on an excellent Cleveland defensive team. Mike enjoyed perhaps his most memorable individual moment on the defensive team when, in the 1954 NFL Championship Game, he stole the ball from Detroit Lions quarterback Bobby Layne to set up one of the early touchdowns in a 56-10 Cleveland rout.But it was as an offensive tackle that McCormack made his lasting mark in pro football. Mike was the Browns' offensive right tackle for eight years from 1955 through 1962. During that period, the Browns\u2019 forward wall played a major role in assuring a balanced offensive approach and McCormack, equally adept as a blocker on rushing plays and as a quarterback protector, was a stabilizing factor throughout the period."

        "Bio": "John McNally still had a year of college eligibility remaining when he decided to take a shot at pro football. To protect his eligibility, he needed an alias, a common practice in the 1920s. He and a friend passed a theater where the movie, Blood and Sand, was playing. Suddenly, McNally exclaimed to his friend: \"That's it. You be Sand. I'll be Blood.\" So \"Johnny Blood\" it was, through 14 seasons in the NFL.At 6-1 and 188-pound \u201cBlood\u201d was unbelievably fast, a superb running back and possibly the finest receiver in the National Football League at that time. He could throw passes and punt with the best.On defense he was a ball hawk and a deadly tackler. He played on five NFL teams in 14 seasons but his best years came with the Green Bay Packers, with whom he was a major contributor to four championship teams in 1929, 1930, 1931, and 1936.His off-the-field antics, however, constantly drew attention away from his exceptional playing skills. A talented youngster, Johnny graduated from high school at 14, an age when he was small and immature and could not compete athletically.At St John's College, however, he began to grow and his natural athletic talents burst into full bloom. He was the basketball team captain and a letter winner in three other sports \u2013 football, baseball and track \u2013 in his junior year.Some say McNally clung so fiercely to boyhood he that never grew up, at least not until after his pro football days which ended when he was coach with the 1939 Pittsburgh Pirates. He didn't marry until he was in his mid-forties and it was his wife Marguerite, who described him most accurately. \"'Even when Johnny does the expected,\" she said, \"he does it in an unexpected way.\""

        "Bio": "For 11 years, Mike Michalske was pro football's premier guard; a position many insist was the toughest job of all in the 1920s and 1930s. A guard in those days was expected to block the biggest opposing linemen head-on.He also had to pull from the line and lead interference for the ball carrier. When the other team had the ball, the guard was the key man in stopping the enemy running attack. But he also had to be capable of storming into the backfield to disrupt a passing play.Michalske was particularly adept at going after the passer. He also championed the idea of using former fullbacks at guard because they were fast and explosive. He sold the idea to Green Bay Packers coach Curly Lambeau and thus it was no accident that many fine Green Bay guards had cut their football teeth as fullbacks.Christened August at birth, Michalske became known as \"Iron Mike\u201d because, while he played 60 minutes every game, he simply never was injured. \"I just didn't get hurt,\" he explained. \"The players used to say I must have been getting paid by the minute.\"In high school and at Penn State, where he was an All-America pick in 1925, he played fullback, guard, end, and tackle. \u201cIron Mike\u201d first turned pro with the new American Football League in 1926 but that league folded after one year.When his New York Yankees NFL team disbanded two seasons later, Michalske, who was all-league each season in New York, waived the $400 salary due him for his free agency. Mike promptly signed with the Packers, where he remained for eight highly successful seasons, both for him and his team. The Packers won NFL titles in 1929, 1930, and 1931, and Michalske was named All-NFL in 1929, 1930, 1931, 1934, and 1935."

For the next few seasons during which the Redskins, who moved to Washington in 1937, won two more divisional titles and one NFL championship, Wayne became the favorite target of the brilliant passer, Sammy Baugh.The two combined for many a blockbuster play during some of the Redskins' finest seasons. In the 1937 championship showdown with the Chicago Bears, Baugh threw touchdown passes of 55 and 78 yards to Millner, then used his as a decoy when he threw the game\u2019s winning pass to Ed Justice. Wayne wound up the day with nine catches for 160 yards.Millner was among the last of the outstanding two-way ends. When he wasn't catching Baugh's passes, he was blocking for him. He was competitive, determined, and known for his sure hands.A \u201cmoney player,\u201d he was always at his best when the stakes were the highest and the pressure was on full force. Millner, who entered the Navy after the 1941 season, wound up his seven-year career in 1945 with 124 receptions for 1,578 yards and 12 touchdowns, which were the best ever for a Redskin up to that time.Had he played for any other pro team, he might have captured more headlines but the Redskins had Baugh who gained most of the publicity. There may also have been one other factor. So often did Millner deliver under pressure, the press and fans and even his own coaches came to take his clutch performances for granted."

Mitchell, who had hoped to play flanker in the pros, was teamed with the incomparable Jim Brown to give the Browns one of history's truly great running back combinations from 1958 through 1961.He also was a breakaway threat as a punt- and kickoff-return specialist. After four productive seasons with the Browns, Bobby was traded to the Washington Redskins where he played with distinction for seven more seasons.With his trade to Washington, Bobby became the first African American to sign and star for the Redskins. In Washington, the 6-0, 192-pound Mitchell was for the most part a full-time flanker who gained the reputation as one of the finest catch-run yardage makers in the game.It is little wonder NFL defenders shuddered whenever Bobby got the ball. He was a potential time bomb who almost always went off. When Mitchell retired, his 14,078 combined net yards was the second highest total in NFL history. He had also scored an amazing 91 touchdowns. Eighteen of his touchdowns came by rushing, 65 on receptions, 3 on punt returns, and 5 on kickoff returns. He amassed 7,954 yards on receptions and 2,735 yards on rushes.He won the NFL receiving title in 1962 with 72 catches.

He was a unanimous all-rookie selection and his 58 receptions were a Redskins' rookie record. Nine times during his 16-season career with the Redskins, New York Jets, and Philadelphia Eagles, the former Syracuse star exceeded 50 catches in a season and five times gained more than 1,000 receiving yards. He also set NFL records for most catches in a season (106), and most consecutive games with at least one reception (164). His consecutive games with a reception streak extended to 183 games. In 1992, with his 820th career catch, he became the NFL's then-all-time leader in receptions. He finished his career with 940 receptions.Monk, at 6-3, 210 pounds, was a prototype for today's bigger, stronger receivers. He got off the line of scrimmage quickly and never hesitated to run patterns across the middle of the field. He was a master of the short pass route that often left defenses unable to adjust, allowing for substantial gains.Art was a major part of the powerful Redskins teams that were dominant during the 1980s. During his 14 seasons with the Redskins, the team won three Super Bowls (XVII, XXII, and XXVI) and had just three losing seasons. It was, however, in 1984 that Monk had his finest season when he caught eight or more passes in six games, had five games of 100 yards or more and in a game against the San Francisco 49ers caught 10 passes for 200 yards. His outstanding play earned him team MVP honors and his first Pro Bowl selection. His season totals of 106 catches for 1,372 yards were career highs.Monk went over the 1,000-yard mark in each of the following two seasons, becoming the first Redskins receiver to produce three consecutive 1,000 yard seasons. He also became the first Redskins player to catch 70 or more passes in three consecutive seasons.Washington coach Joe Gibbs claimed his star receiver was the complete package. He called him the strongest outside receiver he'd ever coached, and was quick to point out his effectiveness at catching passes inside. \"He's big, he's strong, he's intelligent, he has everything,\" the Hall of Fame coach remarked.Monk was an All-Pro and All-NFC choice in 1984 and 1985 and was named second-team All-NFC in 1986.

Regardless of which misguided reason motivated NFL scouts, Moon remained confident of his abilities and opted to sign with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. He went on to lead the Eskimos to an unprecedented five consecutive Grey Cup victories.Eventually, Moon returned to the United States to play for the Houston Oilers in 1984.

Along the way, the team advanced to the playoffs seven consecutive years (1987-1993) and captured the 1991 and 1993 AFC Central Divisional crowns.Munchak was a devastating blocker and considered the key to an offensive line that kept the Oilers at or near the top of the NFL\u2019s offensive statistical categories. In 1988 he led the Oilers\u2019 offensive line that gave up just 24 quarterback sacks which was third in the NFL. It was also the fewest sacks allowed by the team in 10 seasons.The following season the offensive line held opponents to no sacks in six games. In 1991, the Oilers offensive line finished second in the AFC and fourth in the NFL in the fewest quarterback sacks allowed. Behind the Munchak-led line, Houston led the NFL in total offense in 1990 and passing offense in 1990 and 1991. The Oilers finished second in points scored in 1990 and second in total offense in 1991.Equally effective as a run blocker, Munchak led the Oilers offensive charge in 1993 as the team finished fourth in the NFL in both average gain per rushing play (4.4) and average gain per offensive play (5.3). Although he suffered from chronic knee problems, Munchak played in 159 regular season games. His 12 seasons with the Oilers tied him for second longest in the franchise\u2019s history at the time of his retirement."

        "Bio": "Anthony Mu\u00f1oz, a 6-6, 278-pound offensive tackle, was the first-round pick of the Cincinnati Bengals and the third player selected overall in the 1980 NFL Draft. Some considered the pick a risk because of multiple knee injuries and the fact he played only one full game his senior year at the University of Southern California. But as the two-time All-America lineman (1978-1979) proved, the concerns were unnecessary.An exceptional straight-on blocker, Mu\u00f1oz was agile, quick and strong. He had great foot quickness and the mobility necessary to block quick defensive ends. Considered by many to be the premier tackle during his 13 seasons of play, he started 164 of 168 games from 1980 to 1990.An all-around athlete, he even caught seven passes and scored four touchdowns on tackle-eligible plays. His stalwart play was the key to the success that propelled Cincinnati to three AFC Central Division titles and two AFC championships (1981 and 1988).The recipient of virtually every possible honor, Anthony was elected to 11 consecutive Pro Bowls and was named All-Pro 11 consecutive\u00a0times from 1981 through 1991. He was named the NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1981, 1987, and 1988 and the NFL Players Association Lineman of the Year in 1981, 1985, 1988, and 1989.Always in top-notch condition, Mu\u00f1oz missed only three games due to injury. His rigorous routines included working out in the weight room he had installed in his home and running three to four miles every day. He set high personal standards and worked tirelessly to achieve them.Born August 19, 1958, in Ontario, California, Mu\u00f1oz was too big to play Pop Warner football as a youth. Instead, he concentrated on becoming an excellent baseball player. Eventually, as a college sophomore, he pitched for USC\u2019s national championship team in 1978. By then, however, it was clear that his size and his talents were more suited for football."

The big man from little Millikin College starred in football, basketball, baseball, and track.With his pro team, the Chicago Bears, he specialized as a middle guard on defense and excelled in all of his offensive assignments, particularly as a pass blocker and as a pulling guard on running plays. On offense George began his career with the Bears as a tackle, but after four seasons, made the switch to guard when his team\u2019s personnel needs so dictated.Musso played 12 seasons during a period when Chicago was the scourge of pro football. Teammates and opponents alike respected him as a dependable 60-minute performer. His outstanding play often forced teams to alter their game plan, something that was unheard of at the time.His inspirational play contributed to the Bears\u2019 fearsome reputation. A team leader, George was the Bears' captain for nine years. He became the first player to win All-NFL honors at two positions, tackle in 1935 and guard in 1937. Musso also had the rare distinction of playing against two future Presidents of the United States.As a collegian, George once lined up against Ronald Reagan, a guard at Eureka College. Several years later, when the Bears played the College All-Stars his opponent was All-Star Michigan center, Gerald Ford. Prior to joining the Bears in 1933, coach/owner George Halas offered him a tryout and $90 a game if he made the team. To seal the deal, Halas sent the future star $5 for expenses, $3 for the train ride to Chicago and $2 for incidentals. Musso made the team, and, eventually, Halas came through with the weekly $90 salary he first promised the big rookie."

Many eyewitness observers insisted that for sheer brutal line-smashing, no one came close to Nagurski.Never fancy, he just ran straight ahead, over and through the opposition. Although he is best remembered for his bull-like running, he had no peer as a blocker and his tackling was as effective as any the game has seen. He was the complete player.At the University of Minnesota he played four positions and was named All-America at both fullback and tackle. With the Bears, his defensive play was as awesome as his offensive ball carrying.The jump pass, in which he would fake a plunge, then step back a yard or two, jump and lob a pass to a waiting receiver was devastating. His jump pass to Red Grange was responsible for the key touchdown in the Bears\u2019 1932 victory over Portsmouth for the league title.The next year, in the National Football League\u2019s first official championship game, Bronko passed for two touchdowns, including the game-winning score. When Nagurski couldn\u2019t get a raise to $6,500 in 1938, Nagurski retired to become a professional wrestler.But in 1943, when the demands of World War II left the Bears short of manpower, he rejoined the team as a tackle. Late in the season, with Chicago trailing in a must-win game, he went back to the fullback position. The 35-year old Nagurski\u2019s line plunges keyed a drive to the tying touchdown and then set up the winning score. A week later, in the 1943 NFL title game against the Washington Redskins, Bronko, - who was named a first- or second-team All-NFL in seven of his first eight seasons \u2013 ended his career by scoring the touchdown that put the Bears ahead to stay."

The National Football League\u2019s St. Louis Cardinals had also drafted Namath. \u201cBroadway Joe,\u201d as he quickly became known, won a starting job in his third game on his way to AFL Rookie of the Year acclaim in 1965.In 1967, he became the first quarterback to pass for more than 4,000 yards in one season.

After studying the film endlessly, Neale became the first coach to imitate, and some say, improve the Bears\u2019 T-formation.Although it took Neale awhile to pull together the needed talent to build a winning team, once he had the right ingredients, they stayed among the league\u2019s best for nearly a decade.In three years Greasy had the Eagles in second place and, three years later, he had them winning their first divisional crown. His offense was led by the passing of quarterback Tommy Thompson, the pass catching of future Hall of Fame end Pete Pihos, and the running of another Hall of Famer, Steve Van Buren.Defensively, Neale developed the Eagle Defense, which was a mainstay around the league for years to come. The defensive set eventually spawned another National Football League favorite, the 4-3 defense, which is still featured by teams today.From 1944 through 1949, Neale\u2019s Eagles finished second three times and in first place three times. The Eagles won the NFL Championship in 1948 and again in 1949, and were the only team to win back-to-back titles by shutting out their opponents.

At Stanford, Nevers had gained gridiron fame when he courageously led the Indians against Notre Dame in the 1925 Rose Bowl game. Playing on what amounted to two very sore ankles, both of which were broken earlier in the season, Nevers rushed for 114 yards as Stanford lost to the superior Irish, 27-10.Stanford coach, Pop Warner once called him \u201cthe football player without a fault\u201d and compared him favorably to another player he coached, the legendary Jim Thorpe. Like Thorpe, when it came to football, Nevers could do everything exceptionally well, run, pass, kick, call signals, and play rock hard defense.After he finished his Stanford career, Nevers signed pro basketball and baseball contracts and, in fact was destined to throw two homerun pitches to Babe Ruth in his historic 60-home run season in 1927. But pro football also beckoned. In 1926, Nevers turned pro with the NFL\u2019s Duluth Eskimos.The Eskimos were a traveling team. That season the team crossed the country playing 29 games, 28 of them on the road, against league and non-league opponents. Nevers reportedly played all but 29 of a possible 1,740 minutes.Injuries forced Ernie to sit out the entire 1928 season, but he returned as the do-everything man for the Cardinals in 1929. In both 1930 and 1931, he was also the playing coach of the Cardinals. Nevers earned All-NFL honors each of his five pro seasons."

He was a standout as a rookie and thereafter stood out in every game he played for the Rams in a 15- year career. Every game. Fifteen years.As a rookie Olsen was voted into the Pro Bowl. And in the winters that followed they never played a Pro Bowl without him for 14 consecutive years. Ten times he was selected a first- or second-team All-Pro. Merlin came to the Rams as one of their two first round draft choices in 1962.He had the physical qualifications of the best-ever defensive tackles of the day, as evidenced by the fact that he won the Outland Trophy as a collegian at Utah State. But Merlin\u2019s true strength may have been the intelligence he used in each game.During the off-season he earned a master\u2019s degree in economics. It was Olsen's hard luck to perform for many mediocre teams in Los Angeles \u2013 he never won a Super Bowl \u2013 but he had as much to do as any other individual with glamorizing defensive football in the NFL.Before the era of Olsen, and teammate and future Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, this was an offensive league. Few fans talked knowledgeably about defense. Starting in the 1960s the Rams fielded one of the most famous of the front fours of that or any other time, the \u201cFearsome Foursome\u201d of Jones, Olsen, Roosevelt Grier and Lamar Lundy. And the anchor and leader of the group was Olsen. He was the stabilizer in the middle that allowed the others to tee off on quarterbacks. Olsen kept order along the scrimmage line, often stopping the draw play himself or quickly identifying the screen pass."

But it\u2019s difficult to imagine any one player dominating the honors at one position more completely than Jim Otto did both in the American Football League and in the National Football League from 1960 through 1974.The Wausau, Wis., native joined the newly founded Oakland Raiders in 1960 and for the next 15 seasons was the only starting center the Raiders ever had. He was one of only three players who saw action in each of his team\u2019s 140 regular-season games over the AFL\u2019s 10-year history, and he played with such skill that in its entire history, the AFL never had another all-league center.Otto, who starred as a center and linebacker at the University of Miami in Florida, won All-AFL acclaim 10 consecutive seasons. He was All-NFL in 1970 and 1971, then earned second-team All-NFL honors in 1972. Not surprisingly, he was named to the AFL All-Time Team following the 1969 season.During his 15-year career, he participated in each of the nine AFL All-Star Games that were played and in the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl the first three seasons that postseason classic was scheduled. Jim never missed a game. When he retired following the 1974 season, he had started in 210 consecutive games in the regular season and had played in 308 games as a Raider.During that period, the Raiders, who had once been AFL doormats, rose to prominence. Oakland won seven divisional championships in an eight-year period from 1967 through 1974. The 1967 Raiders became AFL champions and played against the NFL\u2019s Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II.

From little Phillips, a small Oklahoma college, Steve began his pro football career in 1924 with the Kansas City Blues (later Cowboys), a traveling team that played all their games on the road.After a brief stay with the Cleveland Bulldogs, he was sold to the New York Giants in 1926 for $500. Owen played seven seasons with the Giants, 1926-1931 and 1933. In 1930, he was both a player and the team\u2019s co-coach. Although he continued to play, he was named the sole head coach in 1931.Then, in 1933, he stopped playing and devoted all his efforts to coaching. Owen and the Mara family, who owned the Giants never had a contract. He coached 24 seasons, 1930-1953, on just a handshake. Stout Steve Owen believed in basic fundamental football, and he was successful with his basic style. His real strength was in coaching defense.Under his tutelage, the Giants played in eight of the first 14 championship games of the National Football League. The team\u2019s victory in the 1934 \u201cSneakers Game\u201d is well documented. He coached the Giants to another title in 1938. He originated the \u201cumbrella defense\u201d \u2013 the secondary was likened to an umbrella with four deep defensive backs representing the umbrella\u2019s spokes.The spokes include future Hall of Famers Emlen Tunnell and Tom Landry. He successfully used this defense to contain the powerful pass-oriented Cleveland Browns when they joined the NFL in 1950. Owen left the Giants following the 1953 season, but before he did he developed some of the greatest players and toughest teams in history. His 155 career victories attest to his success."

After a 3-12-1 season in his first year, the Giants made the postseason as a wild-card team the next two years. Each time the eventual Super Bowl champions eliminated the vastly improved Giants from the playoffs. In 1986, the Giants finished 14-2 and capped the year with a victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.After a two-year absence, the Giants returned to the playoffs in 1989 as NFC Eastern Division champions.

He returned to coaching in 1993 when he took over the struggling New England Patriots, who were fresh off of a 2-14 record and were on a four-year skid of losing seasons.  Within two years, Parcells coached the team to a 10-6 mark and its first playoff game in eight years. Two seasons later, the Patriots posted an 11-5 record and won the AFC championship to earn a berth in Super Bowl XXXI.Parcells\u2019 third head coaching job came in 1997 with the New York Jets, who had gone eight seasons without a winning record and had a 1-15 mark in 1996.  With Parcells, the Jets improved to 9-7 in his first season at the helm. The following year, he guided New York to a 12-4 record, and the Jets advanced to the AFC Championship Game.

But after the 1937 baseball season, he obtained permission from the Athletics to give pro football a try.He joined the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National Football League, still really expecting to play out just one pro football season and then call it a career. History now records that the 1937 season wasn't \"the end of it\" for the 5-10, 178-pound fireball. Ace stayed with the Dodgers until World War II military service interrupted his career in 1942.He returned to the pros in 1945 with the Boston Yanks then added a brilliant final campaign with the New York Yankees of the All-America Football Conference in 1946.Interestingly, it was baseball and not the huge NFL linemen that Ace faced every weekend that proved to be the biggest stumbling block in his career. Broken ankles twice endangered his pro football career and, in 1940, he won Most Valuable Player honors in the NFL even though he had suffered a broken left ankle in a summer baseball game that year. For the first three weeks of the season, he had to wear a 10-pound brace that extended from his ankle to his knee.Ace wasn't exceptionally fast anyway, but he continued doing just what he had always done \u2013 running, passing, catching passes, punting, placekicking, returning punts and kickoffs and playing defense. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the early 1940s were a constant threat to the New York Giants and Washington Redskins for supremacy in their division and Parker was the guiding force of the Dodgers attack."

Jim had been a two-way tackle, an All-America and the Outland Award winner as the nation's top lineman at Ohio State.Although his college coach thought his best shot in the pros would be on defense, Colts' coach Weeb Ewbank tabbed Jim as an offensive lineman. The Colts at the time were just evolving as an National Football League power and the premier passer in the game, Johnny Unitas, was the guy who made the Baltimore attack click.Parker had little experience in pass blocking, but Ewbank was sure Parker could do the job. \"It didn't take me long to learn the one big rule,\" Parker remembered. \"\u2019Just keep them away from John,\u2019 Coach Ewbank told me at my first practice. \u2018You can be the most unpopular man on the team if the quarterback gets hurt.' I couldn't forget that!\" And Parker didn't forget.The fact that he was assigned to protect such a famous teammate may explain why Parker seemed to attract more publicity than is usually accorded to offensive linemen. Another reason is that he was such an exceptional craftsman. In an out-of-the-ordinary twist, Jim divided his career almost evenly between left tackle and left guard.Each job had its distinct set of responsibilities. Even the opponents were different. As a tackle, he went head-to-head against the faster, more agile defensive ends. At guard, his daily foes were the bigger and stronger defensive tackles. Parker handled both positions in all-pro fashion. At left tackle he earned All-Pro honors four straight times from 1958 to 1961.In the middle of the 1962 season he was moved to left guard and at year\u2019s end was named All-Pro at both tackle and guard. He then followed up with three straight seasons of earning All-Pro accolades at guard (1963 to 1965). During this period Parker played in eight consecutive Pro Bowls."

One of the truly great iron men of pro football, during his nine seasons of play, he missed just one game.Immediately after Pete joined the Eagles, the team marched to its first divisional championship. In the playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers for the Eastern Division crown, he blocked a punt to set up the first touchdown in the Eagles 21-0 win. Philadelphia won three straight divisional championships and then back-to-back NFL titles by shutout scores. In 1948, the Eagles defeated the Chicago Cardinals 7-0.

Injuries were widespread. Officiating was haphazard and often biased. Antiquated rules were loosely interpreted and randomly enforced. Once he joined the NFL, Shorty insisted his officials became absolute masters of the rules book. He gave them written tests and demanded that they score better than 95 percent every time.Player safety and speed of play were always prime factors in his annual proposals. Ray made more than 300,000 stopwatch observations during his NFL tenure.

This was shocking news because, less than a month earlier, the Rams had won the NFL championship. Add to that, air travel was still in its early stages and Los Angels was 2,000 miles away from the nearest NFL city.Most important, Reeves' fellow NFL owners were dead set against the move. But Reeves was just as determined. It took a sometimes-bitter fight and even a threat to withdraw from the NFL before Reeves could convince his colleagues he meant business.Once the move was made, the Rams had to fight a life-and-death struggle with the rival Dons of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Reeves had lost money in trickles in Cleveland but his initial losses in Los Angeles came in tidal waves. The AAFC folded in 1949 just as the Rams were embarking on a string of outstanding seasons on the field.Boasting some of football's most glamorous stars, the Rams won four divisional titles in seven years and the NFL championship in 1951. The effect at the gate was astounding. Topped by a crowd of 102,368 for a San Francisco 49ers game in 1957, turnouts in the Los Angeles Coliseum surpassed 80,000 on 22 occasions during the Rams' first two decades in California.The innovative Reeves made several other significant contributions to pro football. He instituted the famed \"Free Football for Kids\" program that enabled youngsters to enjoy the game in their formative years and then, hopefully, become ardent fans as adults. His signing of the ex-UCLA great, Kenny Washington, in the spring of 1946 marked the first time a black player had been hired in the NFL since 1933. Dan's experimentation in the early days of television provided the groundwork for pro football's current successful TV policies. He was also the first to employ a full-time scouting staff."

The reason Ringo\u2019s the best in the league is because he's quick and he's smart. He runs the offensive line, calls the blocks and he knows what every lineman does on every play.\" It's estimated that Ringo handled the ball (only the quarterback can match him) more than 12,000 times in his career, including around 1,000 snapbacks for punts or placekicks.

The man behind the idea of NFL Films was Ed Sabol.Sabol, an aspiring filmmaker, was selling overcoats for his father-in-law in Philadelphia when at age 45 he hatched the idea of forming Blair Productions, a film company he named after his daughter. In 1962 Sabol contacted National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle with an offer to double the $1,500 bid for the rights to film the 1962 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers. Rozelle accepted and Sabol's film company was off and rolling.From the very start, Sabol incorporated a unique creative angle inspired by his background in the drama society at Ohio State and a brief stint on Broadway. Rather than use a single camera located high in the stadium that day, Sabol added a sideline camera to catch the intensity of the players. Blair Productions continued to shoot NFL action for the next two years before Sabol convinced NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and the 14 team owners that they needed their own motion picture company. With that, NFL Films was born. Sabol served as the President of NFL Films until 1985 when he turned over the role to his son Steve. The senior Sabol continued to serve as the Chairman of NFL Films through his retirement in 1995.During his tenure, NFL Films won 52 Emmy Awards.With Ed Sabol's vision, NFL Films has revolutionized the manner in which sports are presented on camera. Many firsts in film were introduced under his leadership ranging from the first use of a microphone on coaches, referees and players; use of a reverse-angle replay; adding popular music to footage; and the ever popular bloopers videos.NFL Films has continually adapted to new technology while maintaining its dramatic storytelling technique. The company began producing weekly NFL highlight shows in the late 1960s, introduced the first sports home video in 1980, and today remains at the forefront of the film industry. In 2002, the company moved into a 200,000-square-football facility that includes productions studios and massive film library.Ed Sabol's innovations have clearly changed the way that fans watch football."

His 44 receptions for 283 yards in 1994 gave him a combined 2,166 yards from scrimmage. The most impressive feat of his remarkable career, however, came in 1997, when he rushed for a league-best 2,053 yards and gained another 305 yards on 33 catches for an amazing 2,358 combined yards gained. That year, Sanders, who was named league Most Valuable Player, gained more than 100 yards rushing in an NFL record 14 consecutive regular season games.Though not big by most standards, Sanders capitalized on his size by running low to the ground making him less of a target for would-be tacklers. His elusiveness and ability to reverse direction seemingly at will, often left defensive players grasping at air. \u201cHe makes you miss so bad, you kind of look up in the stands and wonder if anybody\u2019s looking at you,\u201d Atlanta Falcons cornerback D.J.

But injuries continued to take their toll and, just before the 1972 season, Gale finally had to call it quits.In his relatively short career, he compiled a record that can never be forgotten.

He was voted to the NFL all-league team ten times. He was elected to the Pro Bowl ten straight years from 1955 through 1964 and his teammates voted him their Most Valuable Player four times.For all of those honors, perhaps the finest accolade an athlete can earn is the universal respect of his opponents and teammates and Joe earned this kind of acclaim in abundance. Joe also can have the satisfaction of knowing that his presence played a big role in changing defensive play in professional football.Schmidt didn't exactly create the middle linebacker position but it was a job that was developed in the 1950s with the change of the ordinary defensive structure to the 4-3 frontal alignment. Without question, he was the first to play the position with such finesse that even the masses in the stands could see the growing value of the \"defensive quarterback.\" He anticipated plays with uncanny accuracy. He was a deadly tackler. He was fast enough to evade a 250-pound guard, to follow a play along the line or to drop back to cover a pass. He was strong enough to power past a potential blocker to crumble a play. But his greatest talent may well have been his uncanny knack of knowing what the opposition was going to do."

He heard that Dallas had planned to use him as a linebacker.The fact that he went on to become one of the best and most-honored guards of the 1960s proves that he chose well. The stereotypical view of the AFL in the early 1960s was that of a pass-happy league. That, however, was not the case in Buffalo, where the Bills featured power running and a strong defense.Equally adept at pass blocking and run blocking, his ability to pull out in front of runners was a perfect fit for the Bills. In fact, because Buffalo\u2019s runners tended to be more durable than fast, he sometimes was able to stay in front of them to make blocks far downfield. Shaw\u2019s speed, strength, and natural ability made him \u201cthe driving force of the offensive unit\u201d according to his former offensive line coach Jerry Smith.Especially effective on short-yardage scoring plays, Shaw would pull out from his left guard position followed by heavy-duty runners Cookie Gilchrist and Wray Carlton. Bills\u2019 quarterback Jack Kemp or his super-sub Daryle Lamonica would follow the powerful trio of blockers \u2013 often untouched \u2013 into the end zone.The Bills of 1962, 1963, and 1964 still rank among the best in the team record book for most rushing touchdowns scored in a season.

Simpson, a two-time All-America from the University of Southern California and the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner, was one of history's most heralded rookies when the Buffalo Bills selected him as the No. 1 player in the entire 1969 draft.His career record for 11 seasons, the first nine in Buffalo and the 1978 and 1979 campaigns in San Francisco, confirms the rave notices were well founded. He rushed for 11,236 yards, added 2,142 yards on 203 pass receptions, returned 33 kickoffs 990 yards for a superb 30-yard average, and amassed 14,368 combined net yards. He scored 456 points on 76 touchdowns.O. J. was not an immediate success and, in fact, did not even win Rookie of the Year acclaim in 1969. Incredibly, he was used sparingly as a running back through his first three campaigns until Lou Saban took over the reins in 1972 and immediately decided to give the 6-1, 212-pound speedster the football as often as possible.Simpson immediately responded with massive ground-gaining performances. O.J. may be best remembered for his sensational 1973 season when he became the first back in history to rush for over 2,000 yards. With 219 yards in the next-to-last game against New England and a 200-yard output in the finale with the New York Jets, Simpson totaled 2,003 yards, tops for a 14-game season.Many say the 1975 season was even better - 1,817 yards rushing, 426 yards on receptions and a then-record 23 touchdowns. O.J. led the league in rushing four years in 1972, 1973, 1975 and 1976.In various selections, he was named NFL Player of the Year in 1972, 1973 and 1975.

At 6-9 and 265 pounds, St. Clair's mere presence on the football field tended to intimidate many opponents.He was blessed with size, speed, intelligence and a genuine love of hitting and, using these traits to the maximum; his on-the-field trademarks became hostility, power, and strength. He was an outstanding blocker, both on passing plays and rushing attempts.Particularly early in his career, he was used on defense in goal line situations. He also excelled on the special teams. In 1956, he was credited with an amazing 10 blocked field goals.Extremely popular with the fans and his teammates, St. Clair served as the 49ers\u2019 team captain in 1957, 1958 and 1959. He was named first- or second-team All-NFL nine times and was selected to play in five Pro Bowls. St. Clair was tough and durable and often played in spite of severe injuries. But injuries eventually did cut short his career.He was sidelined for a good part of the 1962 season with an Achilles tendon injury but he regained his All-Pro form in 1963. But a second Achilles tendon injury forced him to retire before the 1964 season.Born in San Francisco, St. Clair decided to play college football at home at the University of San Francisco. When that school quit football after the 1951 season, he transferred to Tulsa, where he was an All-Missouri Valley Conference star. By joining the 49ers, St. Clair became the ninth member of the 1951 USF team to enter the pros.His teammates nicknamed him \"The Geek\" because of several of his unusual lifestyle habits, such as eating all of his meat raw. He also became active in politics during his playing career and once served as the mayor of Daly City, California."

He was the perfect quarterback for his team. Because it was a balanced attack that he led, Starr's passes were limited \u2013 remarkably, he never threw as many as 300 passes in any one season. This may have helped to create the illusion that he was only an average passer.The statistics, of course, do not bear this out.

Blessed with excellent mobility and burning desire, the Boston College star went on to excel in the game of giants. For the next 14 years, Stautner was a fixture at defensive tackle, a veritable folk hero with long-suffering Steelers fans and a major factor in the Pittsburgh defense, one of the most punishing in the NFL at the time.His outstanding play earned him first- or second-team All-NFL honors nine times. Selected to nine Pro Bowls, Ernie had the unusual distinction for a defensive tackle of winding up not once, but twice, in the NFL record book.

Extremely resilient, the native of Bavaria missed only six games during his entire NFL career. That\u2019s not to say he didn\u2019t suffer a number injuries.

Fearless and huge by the standards of the day, the 6-4, 233-pound Stydahar possessed incredible power and remarkable speed.Flaunting his disdain for superstition by wearing jersey number 13, he was a 60-minute performer who often shunned the use of a helmet. His consistently outstanding play earned him All-NFL recognition 1936 through 1940, and second-team All-NFL acclaim in 1942.Stydahar's tenure as an active player became synonymous with Chicago Bears championships. Starting with his rookie season, he was a fixture at the tackle spot for seven years until he was called into the U.S. Navy following the 1942 season. He returned in 1945 to play for two more years. During that period, the Bears won three NFL championships and five Western Division titles. In Joe's final game, the 1946 Bears defeated the New York Giants, 24-14.

        "Bio": "Lynn Swann joined the Steelers in 1974 just as they were embarking on a winning binge that produced six straight AFC Central Division titles and four Super Bowl championships in six years. A former USC All-America, Swann was the Steelers\u2019 No. 1 draft pick and 21st player selected overall in the 1974 NFL Draft.As a rookie, Swann led the NFL in punt returns with 577 yards on 41 returns, which at that time was a club record and fourth best in NFL history. He did see limited action as a wide receiver, particularly in late season, and his touchdown catch in the AFC championship game against the Oakland Raiders proved to be a game-winner and set the stage for things to come.Blessed with gazelle-like speed, fluid movements and a tremendous leaping ability, Swann became a regular at wide receiver in his second year. Immediately he demonstrated that he was a complete player with phenomenal natural abilities.That season, he recorded 49 catches for 781 yards and a league-high 11 touchdowns and then finished off the season with a flourish by winning Most Valuable Player honors in the Steelers\u2019 21-17 Super Bowl X victory over the Dallas Cowboys. For his part, Swann contributed four receptions for a then-Super Bowl record 161 yards. Included was a spectacular 64-yard catch and run that produced the winning touchdown.Born in Alcoa, Tennessee, on March 7, 1952, Lynn played nine seasons with the Steelers. His lifetime chart showed 336 receptions for 5,462 yards and 51 touchdowns. His combined total of 364 receiving yards in four games ranked first in Super Bowl history at the time of his retirement.Named All-Pro in 1975, 1977, and 1978, Swann was also voted to the Pro Bowl after each of those seasons. One of the most exciting players of his time, Swann was named to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 1970s, and to the Super Bowl Silver Anniversary Team."

        "Bio": "During Paul Tagliabue\u2019s 17-year reign as Commissioner of the National Football League, pro football grew to unparalleled heights.Expansion, labor peace, new stadiums, international operations, unprecedented television coverage and revenues, internet and new technology development are just some of the successes accomplished during his tenure. Today, the NFL is not only the template for success among sports leagues, it is the standard by which all other leagues aspire.Tagliabue was elected to succeed Pete Rozelle on Oct. 26, 1989 to become the seventh chief executive of the NFL. A few months later, the new commissioner set the tone for his administration. At the March 1990 Owners Meetings, Tagliabue and Broadcast Committee Chairman Art Modell announced a new, four-year TV deal worth $3.6 billion, which at that time was the largest in television history. At that same meeting, Tagliabue announced the formation of a Committee on Expansion and Realignment. The committee eventually recommended, and the clubs approved, the addition of two teams (the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers) that began play in the 1995 season.In 1991, Tagliabue and the club owners, recognizing the tremendous potential for pro football on an international basis, launched the World League of American Football. The WLAF (later known as NFL Europe) was the first sports league to operate on a weekly basis on two continents.Labor peace is another hallmark of Tagliabue\u2019s stewardship. In 1993, the NFL and NFL Players Association officially signed a seven-year Collective Bargaining Agreement, which guaranteed more than $1 billion in pension, health, and post-career benefits for current and retired players - the most extensive benefit plan in pro sports. It was the first CBA since 1987 and the first of two successive long-term labor agreements with the players during Tagliabue\u2019s tenure.Under Tagliabue, the NFL also addressed many other key priorities. During the Tagliabue era, the league supported the construction of some 20 new stadiums; created a league-wide Internet network and the subscriber-based NFL TV Network; and secured the largest television contracts in entertainment history, totaling some $25 billion.Before becoming the league\u2019s CEO, Tagliabue represented the NFL as an attorney at Covington & Burling, a Washington, D.C., law firm."

For the next 18 seasons, the 6-0, 190-pound field leader never let up in his relentless quest of yardage and touchdowns.At the time of his retirement, Fran owned every significant passing record \u2013 3,686 pass completions, 47,003 passing yards, and 342 touchdowns.

He became the starting quarterback early in his rookie season and continued his outstanding performances for the next six seasons. But in 1967, he was sent to the New York Giants in a trade that netted the Vikings two No. 1 and two No. 2 draft picks over a three-year period.Five seasons later, Fran came back to Minnesota in another massive swap that cost the Vikings two veterans, a rookie and two high draft picks. In Fran's final seven years with the Vikings (1972-1978), he led Minnesota to six NFC Central Division titles and three Super Bowl appearances.

Lombardi depended upon him to get the needed short yardage whether it was for a first down or a touchdown.As the Packers\u2019 dynasty grew, so too did Taylor become the symbol of power in the awesome Green Bay attack. Jim was a throwback to an earlier era, who ran with a fierceness no one could match. He caught the short swing passes and blocked with rugged determination.Thousand-yard seasons became a specialty for Taylor. He went over 1,000 yards five straight seasons beginning in 1960 but reached his zenith in 1962, when he had a career-high 1,474 yards and was named the NFL Player of the Year.Jim was living testimony to the popular football adage \"When the going gets tough, the tough get going.\" Nowhere was this more evident than in the 1962 NFL title game. Playing on a bitter-cold day, Taylor engaged in a personal duel with the New York Giants' outstanding defense, led by All-Pro linebacker Sam Huff. Jim carried 31 times for 85 yards and scored Green Bay's only touchdown in a 16-7 victory. He took a fearful pounding both from the hard-hitting Giants and the frozen ground. He suffered an elbow gash that took seven stitches to close at halftime and a badly cut tongue. At the end, he could scarcely see and he couldn't talk.Taylor was often compared with Jim Brown, the Cleveland fullback, who played at the same time. There were many different viewpoints but Lombard's summation was most succinct. \"Jim Brown will give you that leg and then take it away from you. Jim Taylor will give it to you and then ram it through your chest!\""

He could pass and catch passes with the best, punt long distances and kick field goals either by dropkick or placekick.Often he would demonstrate his kicking prowess during halftimes by placekicking field goals from the 50-yard line, then turning and dropkicking through the opposite goal post. He blocked with authority and, on defense, was a bone-jarring tackler.Of mixed French, Irish, and Sac and Fox Indian heritage, Thorpe was born in a one-room cabin in Oklahoma, but when he was sixteen his father sent him to the Carlisle Institute, a school for Indian youth. His Native-American name was Wa-Tho-Huk, meaning \"Bright Path,\" something he was destined to follow in the sports world.Excellent at every sport he tried, he gained his greatest fame by winning the decathlon and pentathlon events at the 1912 Olympics, only to have his medals taken away because he had once been paid to play minor-league baseball (the medals were restored posthumously in 1982). Although he played six seasons of major-league baseball, football always remained his favorite sport."

In fact it wasn\u2019t uncommon for a player to leave one team for another during the same season. But, one notable exception to this general pattern was George Trafton, the durable, hard-hitting center of the Chicago Bears between 1920 and 1932.Trafton began his pro career with the Decatur Staleys, forerunner of the Bears, in the first year of the American Professional Football Association, forerunner of the NFL. Trafton followed the Staleys when the team moved to Chicago in 1921. However, in 1922, he took a year off from the pros to serve as an assistant football coach at Northwestern.He returned to the Bears in 1923 and remained there for an additional 10 outstanding seasons. George was an excellent player and a superior competitor. Six times during his 12 seasons he was named to various all-league teams. He also earned, and most observers of the day say rightfully so, a reputation as rough player who was not afraid to get into an on-field scrap.Even teammates like the fabled halfback Red Grange called him the \u201cmeanest, toughest player alive.\u201d One writer reported that Trafton was strongly disliked in every NFL city, with the exception of Green Bay and Rock Island. In those places, \"he was hated.\"Trafton, however, was far more than just a roughneck. He was a skilled defensive player who had the moves of a halfback to go with his size and strength. He was one of the first centers to rove on defense and the very first on offense to center the football with only one hand.

But while the New York newsmen gathered, Chicago Cardinals owner Charles W. Bidwill Sr. announced in Chicago he had signed Trippi to a four-year contract worth $100,000.

Playing on an icy field in Chicago, Charley wore basketball shoes for better traction and totaled 206 yards, including 102 yards on two punt returns. He scored touchdowns on a 44-yard run and a 75-yard punt return.Trippi could and would do anything on a football field. He played as a left halfback for four seasons before switching to quarterback for two years. Charley then moved back to offensive halfback for one campaign before changing almost exclusively to the defensive unit in 1954 and 1955. He also was the Cardinals' punter and he excelled on the punt and kickoff return teams.Due to relaxed regulations during the war years, Charley played in five College All-Star classics, two while at Georgia, two while in the service and a fifth as a Cardinal in 1948."

Yet had it not been for a fortunate set of circumstances while he was still a college player at Hardin-Simmons University, he might never have had the chance to play in the National Football League.Pro football scouting was in the early stages in the late 1930s. Most teams relied on football magazines with their traditional pre-season All-America selections. Players from little-known colleges simply weren't included. Yet not one but two NFL teams eagerly sought Turner.A Hardin-Simmons fan tipped off Frank Korch, a Bears scout, about Turner's abilities during his junior season. After watching Turner, Korch convinced coach George Halas the Bears should draft him. Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions were so sure they had convinced Turner to turn down offers from other NFL teams they didn\u2019t even bother to draft him.For the Bears, acquiring Turner in the first round of the 1940 draft proved to be a masterstroke. For both, the 1940 season marked the beginning of a period of dominance of their particular specialties, the Bears in winning championships and Turner in becoming the best all-round center in pro football. As a linebacker who was blessed with halfback speed, Turner, in 1942, led the league in interceptions with eight.On offense, he was a flawless snapper and an exceptional blocker who could also play guard or tackle. Never was his versatility more evident than in 1944 when he was asked to fill in as a ball carrier in an emergency situation. He consistently ground out long gains, including a 48-yard touchdown romp. Three years later against Washington, Turner came up with what he called the favorite play of his career, a 96-yard interception return for a touchdown."

The only problem, from Van Brocklin's standpoint, was that the Rams already had one future Hall of Fame quarterback in Bob Waterfield.The net result was that two great quarterbacks had to share passing duties for a few seasons, a situation that any great competitor, which Norm certainly was, couldn't be expected to accept with any enthusiasm. Still, Van Brocklin won the NFL passing title in both 1950 and 1952, even though he was playing only half of the time on offense.

        "Bio": "Steve Van Buren answered to a lot of names during his eight-year career in the National Football League, \"Wham Bam,\u201d \"Supersonic Steve,\" \"Blockbuster,\" and several more. Translated, they all meant he was an exceptional football player.To be sure, Steve's pro career was distinctive. He surpassed 1,000 yards rushing twice, won four NFL rushing titles and a rare \u201ctriple crown\u201d in 1945 when he led in rushing, scoring, and kickoff returns. He was a first-team All-NFL selection each of his first six seasons. Van Buren lined up as a halfback but played more like a fullback as the battering ram of a powerful Eagles squad that dominated the NFL in the late 1940s.Philadelphia had never finished above fourth place until Steve came on the scene in 1944. That year they finished second, were runners-up two more years, won three straight divisional titles, and the NFL title in 1948 and 1949.Van Buren provided the offensive punch in both championship victories. In 1949 title game against the Los Angeles Rams, Steve carried 31 times for a record 196 yards as the Eagles won 14-0. A year earlier, Van Buren rushed for 98 yards and scored the game's only touchdown in the Eagles 7-0 title win over the Chicago Cardinals.Born in Honduras, Van Buren was orphaned when he was very young and sent to New Orleans to live with his grandparents. He failed to make the high school football team as a 125-pound high school sophomore, but as a senior he played well enough to win a scholarship to LSU. In his senior season, Van Buren rushed for 832 yards. Encouraged by LSU coach Bernie Moore, the Eagles selected him as their top pick in the draft. It was a break for Van Buren and, for the Eagles, possibly their most fortunate ever."

Yet many National Football League scouts honestly felt that, at 5-11 and 173 pounds, Doak was too small. They predicted the \"big boys\" of the NFL would simply overwhelm him.Walker quickly erased any doubt that he belonged in the NFL. In 1950, he was All-NFL, the Rookie of the Year, the league-scoring champion, and a Pro Bowl participant. The honors kept coming for him.When Doak wound up his six-season career after the 1955 campaign, he had been named All-NFL five times and selected to five Pro Bowls. It\u2019s no coincidence that, during the his six-year career, the Lions enjoyed their finest years ever with three divisional titles and NFL championship victories over the Cleveland Browns in 1952 and 1953.Doak was a do-everything contributor for the Lions. His career chart shows entries in every possible statistical category \u2013 rushing, passing, receiving, punt and kickoff returns, punting, place-kicking and even interceptions. Because he did so many things, his career figures are not overly impressive except in the scoring column, where he scored 534 points and won two NFL scoring titles. Walker had a knack of making the big plays in the most important games.In 1952, he returned from an injury-enforced layoff to throw a 24-yard touchdown pass to Leon Hart in the divisional showdown against the Los Angeles Rams.

While his career totals for numbers of catches might not seem in line with those accumulated by other great receivers, as any student of the game understands, the truth isn\u2019t always in the numbers.A first-round draft pick of the Cleveland Browns in 1964, Paul played in Cleveland six seasons before going to the Miami Dolphins in a blockbuster trade in 1970. He returned to Cleveland in 1976 after five seasons with the Dolphins and one season with Memphis of the failed World Football League.Even though he played on ball-control, run-oriented teams through most of his career, he managed to haul in 427 passes for 8,565 yards and 85 touchdowns. His 20.1 yards-per-catch mark ranks among the best in the history of the game. And he did it with a trademark smooth, graceful style that left observers and victimized defenders awestruck.As a rookie, Warfield caught a career-high 52 passes. His outside speed was the perfect complement to the power running of Jim Brown. During his first six years with the Browns, the team played in four NFL Championship Games, winning the title in 1964. Because of his blazing speed, elusive moves and great leaping ability, defenses often found it necessary to double cover him.Warfield, a six-time All-NFL choice who was elected to eight Pro Bowls, was a long-ball threat who intimidated the opposition. His mere presence on the field proved to be beneficial to the running game. The best example of this might have been in 1972, when the Dolphins went undefeated. That year, Miami ran the ball 613 times while passing on only 259 occasions. The Dolphins\u2019 philosophy was to use the forward pass as a threat to make the ground game more effective. The Dolphins rushed for a then-NFL record 2,960 yards."

He joined the Green Bay Packers and instantly helped turn the fortunes of the once-proud franchise.The team steadily improved and, in 1996, returned to glory with White leading the NFL's topped ranked defense to playoff and Super Bowl victories. In Super Bowl XXXI he recorded a record three sacks.Reggie played two more years in Green Bay. During that period he added 27 more sacks to his repertoire. After a one-year \"retirement\", White returned for a final season with the Carolina Panthers in 2000.White retired as the NFL's all-time sack leader with 198. He was named to the NFL's All-Decade Teams of the 1980 and 1990s, the 75th Anniversary Team, and was voted first-team All-Pro 10 times in his 15-year career."

        "Bio": "Dave Wilcox played collegiate football at Boise Junior College before transferring to Oregon for his final two campaigns. At Boise, he earned junior college All-America honors. A guard on offense (after a move from tight end) and an end on defense, Wilcox played in the Hula Bowl, Coaches\u2019 All-America Bowl and the College All-Star Game.In 1964, he became the first defensive lineman in Hula Bowl history to earn outstanding lineman honors. In 1964, both the Houston Oilers of the young American Football League and the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League sought to sign the Oregon star. The Oilers drafted him in the sixth round (46th player overall) of the AFL Draft, while the 49ers tapped him in the third round (29th player overall) of the NFL Draft.The 6-3, 241-pound Wilcox opted to sign with the more established 49ers, where he went on to star for 11 seasons. Converted to the outside linebacker position, Wilcox quickly established himself as one of the league\u2019s finest. Nicknamed \u201cThe Intimidator,\u201d he was ideally suited for the position, both mentally and physically. Known for his ability to disrupt plays, he was particularly tough on tight ends. He simply didn\u2019t let anybody off the line of scrimmage, whether to block or get into a pass route. Always prepared, Wilcox was a true student of the game and worked to be \u201cfundamentally correct.\u201dHe thrived on action and wanted it all directed his way. \u201cWhat I do best,\u201d Wilcox once stated, \u201cis not let people block me. I just hate to be blocked.\u201d Hall of Fame linebacker Joe Schmidt was impressed by his strength. \u201cHe gave us fits,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThe lead block had to really come out hard to take him out because he was so strong.\u201d Aided by his speed and long reach, he was also effective in pass coverage and managed to intercept 14 passes during his career.Following each season, San Francisco would rate their players based upon their performance. The typical score for a linebacker was 750. Wilcox\u2019s score in 1973 was 1,306. That season, the veteran linebacker recorded 104 solo tackles, four forced fumbles and tackled opposing ball carriers for a loss 13 times. Durable, Wilcox missed only one game during his career due to injury. Five times he was named All-NFL (1967,1970, 1971, 1972, 1973) and three times All-NFC (1971, 1972, 1973). He was also selected to play in seven Pro Bowls."

In the eight years he played for the Cleveland Browns from 1946 through 1953, he was a first-team All-League selection seven times and a second-team choice once. He also played in three NFL Pro Bowls.Bill, an African American, came to his first pro training camp as a comparatively small man seeking a job in a big man's sport that had, for about 15 years, been a whites only game. Lined up as the middle man on a five-man defensive front, Bill overwhelmed the center four straight times, each time crashing into quarterback Otto Graham.Bill's charge was so quick that the coaches felt he had to be offside. But head coach Paul Brown, who had coached Bill at Ohio State, made a personal check and found that his recruit hadn't been offside at all, just exceptionally fast and agile in his defensive charge. That very night, Brown signed Willis to his first pro contract, helping to permanently break pro football\u2019s \u201ccolor barrier\u201d a full year in advance of Jackie Robinson doing the same in major league baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers.Bill played both offense and defense for the Browns but it was at the middle guard position that he earned lasting admiration and acclaim.

It was Bill\u2019s touchdown-saving tackle in a playoff game against the New York Giants that enabled the Browns to continue their quest for the 1950 championship their first year in the NFL after four dominating seasons in the All-America Football Conference."

If the league's passers weren't being smashed to the ground after a safety blitz, they were watching helplessly as Larry, far downfield, was picking off one of his 52 career interceptions.It\u2019s amazing now to ponder that this standout of the 1960s at one time had serious doubts if he would even make the team when he joined the Cardinals as their seventh-round draft choice in 1960. Wilson, a 6-0, 190-pound native of Rigby, Idaho, had been a two-way performer and a scoring leader at Utah but, in the NFL, he quickly found that offensive play was not for him. An early try at cornerback on defense also proved disastrous for the rookie. But in the final preseason game in 1960, Wilson got a chance to start at safety and he made the most of it.Except when sidelined briefly by injuries, Wilson anchored the Cardinals defenses for the rest of his career. Contrary to popular belief, however, he did not invent the safety blitz, but he did capitalize on the maneuver to a degree not reached by any other pro player of the decade. It was, in reality, the abilities that he demonstrated every time he tried the safety blitz that first attracted the attention of the St. Louis coaching staff and assured Larry a place on the team.Larry won first- or second-team all-league honors seven times during his career and played in eight Pro Bowls. He reached his zenith with interceptions in seven straight games in 1966, a year that he led the NFL with 10 steals. Wilson, during his Hall of Fame career, recorded 52 career interceptions for 800 yards and five touchdowns."

He later joined Lamar Hunt and the six other AFL originals who collectively became known as \u201cThe Foolish Club.\u201dIn the beginning, members of the NFL and the sports media regarded the AFL with considerable skepticism. Even though the early years of the AFL were at best a struggle and Wilson was losing money, he \u201cnever once thought of throwing in the towel or selling the team.\u201d Determined to see the league succeed, Wilson even invested in another AFL team to prevent it from financial collapse. \u201cThe Foolish Club\u201d did succeed and following initial talks in January 1965 between Wilson and the late Carroll Rosenbloom, then owner of the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Colts, a full merger plan between the two leagues was developed and implemented.A former President of the AFL, Wilson served on the Expansion Committee of that league and the AFL-NFL Negotiations Committee. He was also prominent in the negotiations, which resulted in a 1977 agreement between the NFL Management Council and the NFL Players Association.Once described as the \u201cconscience\u201d of the NFL, Wilson also served as the Chairman of NFL Pension Committee and Labor Committee, and on the Board of NFL Charities, the Super Bowl Site Selection Committee, and the NFL\u2019s Expansion Committee."

Yary was named first-team All-Pro six times (1971-76) and All-NFC eight consecutive seasons (1970-77).

He was the 1967 winner of both the Outland Trophy and the Knute Rockne Award, honors that annually go to the nation\u2019s top collegiate lineman. The Vikings used a draft choice gained in the trade that sent quarterback Fran Tarkenton to the New York Giants to pick Yary at No. 1 in 1968.In addition to his many playing abilities, Yary also was durable and willing to play in spite of injuries. He missed only two games due to injuries \u2013 both coming in 1980 with a broken ankle \u2013 in 14 years in Minnesota. Later that same year, he continued to play in spite of a broken foot."

His impact was immediate: six sacks in 16 starts and a spot on the NFL All-Rookie Team.\rBy 1996, he had blossomed into a dominant force at defensive tackle, turning in his best season statistically: 84 tackles, four passes defensed, two safeties and 11.5 sacks, a figure that led the team and shared the NFL lead for all defensive tackles.

As the 20th player selected in the first round of the 1971 draft, Youngblood made his presence felt almost immediately.He did so well as a backup to superstar \"Deacon\" Jones at left defensive end as a rookie that the Rams traded Jones before the 1972 season. Youngblood divided his playing time with Fred Dryer that year,\u00a0then took over as the starting left defensive end in his third campaign in 1973. He played with distinction at that position the rest of his 202-game career.Youngblood, who was born January 26, 1950, in Jacksonville, Florida, was rugged, determined, a dominant defender and the Rams\u2019 perennial quarterback sack leader. He played in a Rams-record 201 consecutive games and only missed one game in 14 seasons, that one miss coming in his final year in 1984.The Rams\u2019 defensive captain, he was a three-time winner of the Dan Reeves Award, given to that team\u2019s most valuable player each season.

        "Bio": "Offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman is one of just a handful of players to earn the honor of being named to two National Football League All-Decade Teams. His superior play earned him a spot on the NFL's 1980s All-Decade Team even though he played just four seasons during the decade. Following the 1999 season, he was named to the 1990s All-Decade Team as well.Originally selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 1984 supplemental draft, Zimmerman's signing rights were traded to the Minnesota Vikings for two second-round picks in the 1986 draft. Also drafted by the Los Angeles Express of the failed United States Football League, Zimmerman spent two seasons with the Express before reporting to the Vikings in 1986. Gary was later acquired by the Denver Broncos in a trade with Minnesota prior to the last preseason game of the 1993 season.After joining the Vikings in 1986, Zimmerman began a streak of 169 consecutive starts that lasted until 1996 when late-season shoulder surgery sidelined him. Along the way he earned first- or second-team All-Pro honors eight times. During the same period he was selected to play in seven Pro Bowls.In Minnesota, Zimmerman anchored an offensive line that helped the Vikings lead the NFC in rushing in 1991. In Denver, with Zimmerman blocking, the Broncos recorded their most successful offensive output in franchise history. The Broncos led the AFC in total combined yards in 1995 and led the NFL in that category in 1996 and 1997. The team also led the NFL in rushing in 1996.Zimmerman was equally adept at pass blocking, as evidenced by the fact that Minnesota and Denver quarterbacks led their conferences in passing in 1986, 1988, 1993, and 1996.Although Zimmerman managed to play in 169 consecutive games and a total of 184 games during his career, he was no stranger to injury and pain. In 1996, the durable lineman played with severe pain in both shoulders. His consecutive game streak reluctantly came to a halt when late-season surgery on one of his injured shoulders forced him to the sidelines.Zimmerman's ability to persevere and his desire to play, earned him the respect and admiration of teammates and opponents alike. Even though he missed the final two games of the 1996 season he was still selected to play in the Pro Bowl and was voted first-team All-Pro honors."
